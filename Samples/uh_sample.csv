The chemical composition, origin, and transport of air upwind and over Los Angeles, California, were studied using measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), ozone, reactive nitrogen species, and meteorological parameters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration WP-3D aircraft on 18 research flights in California in May and June 2010. On six flights, multiple vertical profiles from 0.2-3.5 km above ground level were conducted throughout the Los Angeles (LA) basin and over the Pacific Ocean. Gas phase compounds measured in 32 vertical profiles are used to characterize air masses in the FT over the LA basin, with the aim of determining the source of increased ozone observed above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Four primary air mass influences were observed regularly in the FT between approximately 1 and 3.5 km altitude: upper tropospheric air, long-range transport of emissions, aged regional emissions, and marine air. The first three air mass types accounted for 89% of the FT observations. Ozone averaged 71 ppbv in air influenced by the upper troposphere, 69 ppbv in air containing emissions transported long distances, and 65 ppbv in air with aged regional emissions. Correlations between ozone and CO, and ozone and nitric acid, demonstrate entrainment of ozone from the FT into the LA PBL. Downward transport of ozone-rich air from the FT into the PBL contributes to the ozone burden at the surface in this region and makes compliance with air quality standards challenging.",,,,"Pollack, Ilana B/F-9875-2012; Dube, William/I-1658-2013; Lefer, Barry/X-9091-2019; Neuman, Andy/A-1393-2009; Holloway, John S/F-9911-2012; Nowak, John B/B-1085-2008; Graus, Martin G/E-7546-2010; Aikin, Kenneth C/I-1973-2013; Trainer, Michael KL/H-5168-2013; Angevine, Wayne M/H-9849-2013; Parrish, David D/E-8957-2010; Brown, Steven S/I-1762-2013; Wagner, Nicholas L/E-7437-2010; Ryerson, Thomas/C-9611-2009; Roberts, James M./A-1082-2009; Smit, Herman/J-2397-2012; de Gouw, Joost/A-9675-2008; Brioude, Jerome/E-4629-2011","Pollack, Ilana B/0000-0001-7151-9756; Dube, William/0000-0003-1286-4087; Lefer, Barry/0000-0001-9520-5495; Neuman, Andy/0000-0002-3986-1727; Holloway, John S/0000-0002-4585-9594; Nowak, John B/0000-0002-5697-9807; Graus, Martin G/0000-0002-2025-9242; Aikin, Kenneth C/0000-0001-8540-9291; Trainer, Michael KL/0000-0002-1668-2961; Angevine, Wayne M/0000-0002-8021-7116; Parrish, David D/0000-0001-6312-2724; Wagner, Nicholas L/0000-0001-9936-1145; Ryerson, Thomas/0000-0003-2800-7581; Roberts, James M./0000-0002-8485-8172; Smit, Herman/0000-0002-2268-4189; de Gouw, Joost/0000-0002-0385-1826; ",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,9-Mar,2012.0,117.0,,,,,,,,D00V09,10.1029/2011JD016919,,,,,,,WOS:000301498500006,,,,,,Houston

It has been used to model different types of waves propagating in elastic and anelastic media. The diffusive-viscous wave equation was proposed to investigate the relationship between frequency dependence of reflections and fluid saturation. It is also used to describe the attenuation property of seismic wave in a fluid-saturated medium. The attenuation of diffusive-viscous wave is mainly characterised by the effective attenuation parameters in the equation. Thus, it is essential to obtain those parameters and further characterise the features of the diffusive-viscous wave. In this work, we use inversion method to obtain the effective attenuation parameters through quality factor QPto investigate the characteristics of diffusive-viscous wave by comparing with those of the viscoacoustic wave. Then, the reflection/transmission coefficients in a dip plane-layered medium are studied through coordinate transform and plane-wave theory. Consequently, the reflectivity method is extended to compute seismograms of diffusive-viscous wave in a dip plane multi-layered medium. Finally, we present two models to simulate the propagation of diffusive-viscous wave in a dip plane multi-layered medium by comparing the results with those in a viscoacoustic medium. The numerical results demonstrate the validity of our extension of reflectivity method to the diffusive-viscous medium. The numerical examples in both time domain and time-frequency domain show that the reflections from a dip plane interface have significant phase shift and amplitude change compared with the results of horizontal plane interface due to the differences in reflection/transmission coefficients. Moreover, the modelling results show strong attenuation and phase shift in the diffusive-viscous wave compared to those of the viscoacoustic wave.","[Zhao, Haixia; Peng, Jigen] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jinghuai] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Natl Engn Lab Offshore Oil Explorat, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Haixia] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Zhao, HX (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Zhao, HX (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",haixia19861220@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41504091, 41390454]; Foundation Research Project of Shaanxi Province [2016JQ4005]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M570818]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [xjj2017179]; National Science and Technology Major Project of China [2016ZX05024-001-007, 2017ZX050609]","The authors thank Dr. Wenchao Chen and Dr. Xiaokai Wang at Xi'an Jiaotong University for their discussion of CWT spectra.

Two different numerical experiments were designed based on the on- and off-aerosol feedback option to evaluate the impact of aerosol DRE on the simulated meteorology and solar radiation. We find that the spatial pattern of the decrease in solar radiation does not agree with that of the PM2.5 concentrations. The largest decrease in solar radiation occurs around the southwest part of Korea (G1), where much lower PM2.5 concentrations appear, compared to other inland regions (G2). The investigation of the chemical species that constitute PM2.5 reveals that the G1 sites have a relatively higher fraction of sulfate (S/PM2.5) than the G2 sites. This finding reveals that the higher sulfate loading over Korea could lead to the larger aerosol DRE. The high sulfate loading, which mainly appeared in the southwest part of Korea, was identified as not only originating from national local emission sources, but also from the long-range transport (LRT) of sulfate and its precursors. Overall, the regionally different distributions of aerosol DRE, especially for solar radiation in Korea, can be attributed partly to the different contributions of the chemical species that constitute PM2.5, particularly sulfate.","[Yoo, Jung-Woo] Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Jeon, Wonbae; Lee, Hwa Woon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Park, Soon-Young] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Earth & Environm Modeling Studies, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Park, Changhyoun] Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Environm Studies, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Jung, Jia] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Lee, Soon-Hwan] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Earth Sci Educ, Busan 46241, South Korea","Lee, HW (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea.",hwlee@pusan.ac.kr,,"Jeon, Wonbae/0000-0002-4898-7292",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2017R1A2B4002707],This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. NRF-2017R1A2B4002707).,"Adams PJ, 2001, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V106, P1097, DOI 10.1029/2000JD900512; Chu DA, 2013, ATMOS ENVIRON, V79, P172, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.06.031; Fast JD, 2006, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V111, DOI 10.1029/2005JD006721; Forkel R, 2012, ATMOS ENVIRON, V53, P202, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.10.009; Fuzzi S, 2015, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V15, P8217, DOI 10.5194/acp-15-8217-2015; Gan CM, 2015, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V15, P12193, DOI 10.5194/acp-15-12193-2015; Giorgi F, 2003, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V58, P345, DOI 10.1023/A:1023946010350; Grell GA, 2005, ATMOS ENVIRON, V39, P6957, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2005.04.027; Gustafson WI, 2007, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V34, DOI 10.1029/2007GL030021; Heo JB, 2009, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V9, P4957, DOI 10.5194/acp-9-4957-2009; Hogrefe C, 2015, ATMOS ENVIRON, V115, P683, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.12.034; Hong CP, 2017, GEOSCI MODEL DEV, V10, P2447, DOI 10.5194/gmd-10-2447-2017; Hong SY, 2004, MON WEATHER REV, V132, P103, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(2004)132<0103:ARATIM>2.0.CO;2; Huang Y, 2007, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V112, DOI 10.1029/2006JD007114; Itahashi S, 2012, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V46, P6733, DOI 10.1021/es300887w; Jacob DJ, 2009, ATMOS ENVIRON, V43, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.09.051; Jacobson MZ, 1998, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V103, P10593, DOI 10.1029/98JD00287; Jeon W, 2018, ATMOS ENVIRON, V186, P102, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.05.017; Jeon W, 2016, GEOSCI MODEL DEV, V9, P3671, DOI 10.5194/gmd-9-3671-2016; Jeon W, 2015, ATMOS ENVIRON, V122, P763, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.10.050; Kain JS, 2004, J APPL METEOROL, V43, P170, DOI 10.1175/1520-0450(2004)043<0170:TKCPAU>2.0.CO;2; Lee K, 2015, J AIR WASTE MANAGE, V65, P445, DOI 10.1080/10962247.2014.1001883; Li M, 2017, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V17, P935, DOI 10.5194/acp-17-935-2017; Miao YC, 2017, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V17, P3097, DOI 10.5194/acp-17-3097-2017; Nolte CG, 2015, GEOSCI MODEL DEV, V8, P2877, DOI 10.5194/gmd-8-2877-2015; Pleim JE, 2007, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V46, P1396, DOI 10.1175/JAM2534.1; Pleim JE, 2007, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V46, P1383, DOI 10.1175/JAM2539.1; Pleim JE, 2009, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V48, P1362, DOI 10.1175/2009JAMC2053.1; Qiu YL, 2017, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V122, P5955, DOI 10.1002/2016JD026309; Satheesh SK, 2000, NATURE, V405, P60, DOI 10.1038/35011039; Tsai TC, 2011, ATMOS ENVIRON, V45, P4777, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2009.10.006; Vardoulakis S, 2008, ATMOS ENVIRON, V42, P3949, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.12.021; Wang J., 2016, J GEOPHYS RES ATMOS, V121; Wang JD, 2014, ENVIRON RES LETT, V9, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/9/9/094002; Whitten GZ, 2010, ATMOS ENVIRON, V44, P5346, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2009.12.029; Wong DC, 2012, GEOSCI MODEL DEV, V5, P299, DOI 10.5194/gmd-5-299-2012; Xing J, 2015, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V15, P9997, DOI 10.5194/acp-15-9997-2015; Xing J, 2017, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V17, P9869, DOI 10.5194/acp-17-9869-2017; Xing J, 2015, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V120, DOI 10.1002/2015JD023933; Xiu AJ, 2001, J APPL METEOROL, V40, P192, DOI 10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<0192:DOALSM>2.0.CO;2; Yan SM, 2017, SCI REP-UK, V7, DOI 10.1038/srep46216; Yang Y, 2017, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V17, P8903, DOI 10.5194/acp-17-8903-2017; Yu H, 2006, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V6, P613, DOI 10.5194/acp-6-613-2006; Yu S, 2014, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V14, P11247, DOI 10.5194/acp-14-11247-2014; Zhang B, 2015, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V15, P2387, DOI 10.5194/acp-15-2387-2015; Zhang Y, 2010, ATMOS ENVIRON, V44, P3568, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.05.056",46.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1352-2310,1873-2844,,ATMOS ENVIRON,Atmos.

We have investigated its use to compute seismic interpretive attributes, such as peak frequency and bandwidth. The S-transform normalizes a frequency-dependent Gaussian window by a factor proportional to the absolute value of frequency. This normalization biases spectral amplitudes toward higher frequency. At a given time, the S-transform spectrum has similar characteristics to the Fourier spectrum of the derivative of the waveform. For narrowband signals, this has little impact on the peak frequency of the time-frequency analysis. However, for broadband seismic signals, such as a Ricker wavelet, the S-transform peak frequency is significantly higher than the Fourier peak frequency and can thus be misleading. Numerical comparisons of spectra from a variety of waveforms support the general rule that S-transform peak frequencies are equal to or greater than Fourier-transform peak frequencies. Comparisons on real seismic data suggest that this effect should be considered when interpreting S-transform spectral decompositions. One solution is to define the unscaled S-transform by removing the normalization factor. Tests comparing the unscaled S-transform with the S-transform and the short-windowed Fourier transform indicate that removing the scale factor improves the time-frequency analysis on reflection seismic data. This improvement is most relevant for quantitative applications.","[Wu, Lin; Castagna, John] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA","Wu, L (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",lwu8@uh.edu; jpcastagna@uh.edu,,,Lumina Geophysical LLC,"My sincerest thanks go to my supervisor John Castagna for sharing his expertise in spectral decomposition techniques and for enlightenment, guidance, and encouragement.

This study combines sedimentological, magnetostratigraphical and geochronological data to infer the timing and origin of the Lobo Formation. Measured sections of Lobo strata at two locations, Capitol Dome in the Florida Mountains and in the Victorio Mountains, indicate significant differences in depositional environments and sediment provenance. At Capitol Dome, where Lobo strata were deposited above a syncline developed in Palaeozoic strata, deposition took place in fluvial, palustrine and marginal lacustrine settings, with alluvial-fan deposits only at the top of the formation. Combined magnetostratigraphy and a young U-Pb detrital zircon age suggest deposition of the section at Capitol Dome from similar to 60 to 52Ma. The Lobo Formation in the Victorio Mountains was deposited in alluvial-fan and fluvial settings; the age of deposition is poorly bracketed between 66 +/- 2Ma, the weighted-mean age of two young zircons, and middle Eocene (similar to 40Ma), the approximate age of overlying volcanic rocks. U-Pb zircon ages from sandstones at the Victorio and Capitol Dome localities indicate that different source rocks provided sediment to the Lobo Formation. Local Proterozoic basement (similar to 1.47-1.45Ga) dominated the source of the Lobo Formation in the Victorio Mountains, consistent with abundant granitic clasts that are present in the proximal facies there; a diverse range of grain ages suggest that recycled Lower Cretaceous strata provided the dominant source for Lobo Formation sediment at the Capitol Dome locality. The U-Pb data suggest that the depositional systems at the two sites were not connected. Contrasts in depositional setting and detrital zircon provenance indicate that the Palaeogene Lobo Formation in southwest New Mexico was deposited in an assemblage of local depositional settings, possibly in separate structural basins, as a consequence of Laramide tectonics in the region.","[De los Santos, Marie G.; Copeland, Peter; Hall, Stuart A.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [De los Santos, Marie G.; Licht, Alexis] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lawton, Timothy F.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Geociencias, Queretaro, Mexico; [Licht, Alexis] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Copeland, P (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",copeland@uh.edu,"Licht, Alexis/P-4284-2018","Licht, Alexis/0000-0002-5267-7545",University of Houston GeoSociety,"We thank Jolante van Wijk and the University of Houston GeoSociety for the generous support of our field work.

In recent decades, the dramatic reduction in water discharge and sediment load due to climate change and human activities in the drainage basin has greatly constrained the evolution process of Yellow River delta. We highlight how runoff and sediment load discharged into sea affected extension of shoreline length and area of modern Yellow River delta during 1976-2009 based on remote sensing interpretation and long-term monitoring data in hydrological station. Average runoff of 207.47x10(8) m(3) yr(-1) and average sediment load of 4.63x10(8) m(3) yr(-1) were discharged into the sea from 1976 to 2008. The annual runoff reduced by similar to 59.7% in 1990-2002 and annual sediment load reduction up to similar to 72.1% in 2003-2008. Both shoreline length and area of Yellow River Delta extended overall in the studied period, but with decreasing rates in accordance with changes of runoff and sediment load. High increasing rate of shoreline length of similar to 3.63 km yr(-1) and quick area extension of similar to 16.26 km(2) yr(-1) were observed in 1976-1985. Since 1996 however, the average increase rate of shoreline length and area decreased to similar to 0.80 km yr(-1) and similar to 3.94 km(2) yr(-1), respectively. In addition, the fluctuated changes of shoreline and area were great and the net negative increase of land area was occurred during this period. There exist significant exponential relationships between the accumulated sediment load and extensions of shoreline length and the area during the evolution of the modern Yellow River Delta. Our results indicate that the evolution of shoreline and change of area of the Yellow River Delta are directly affected by the dramatic reduction of runoff and sediment load, which are much close related human being activities in Yellow River drainage basin in recent decades.",,,,,"Yu, Junbao/0000-0002-3433-3538",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,,,,,,2011.0,8.0,9,,,,,2427,2435,,10.5194/bg-8-2427-2011,,,,,,,WOS:000295375700002,,,,,,Houston

However, rock-physics analysis of well logs in a particular prospect area where such ambiguity exists suggests that attributes derived using extended elastic impedance (EEI) inversion may help identify hydrocarbons because they better show anomalous behavior in particular directions that are readily related to pore fluids and lithology. The EEI attributes calculated from well logs correlate extremely well to lithology and fluid properties, thereby differentiating amplitude anomalies caused by gas-bearing sandstones encased in shale from similar amplitudes caused by juxtaposition of high-impedance carbonates over lower impedance water-filled sandstones. Comparing seismically derived EEI attributes to well logs from a productive well and a nonproductive well indicates that seismic inversion can successfully identify lithologies such as shales, sandstones, carbonates, and anhydrite and distinguish gas-bearing from water-bearing sandstones. The technique can thus potentially be used to better delineate and risk prospects in the area, as well as assisting exploration efforts in other locations where similar ambiguities in amplitude interpretation exist.",,,,"Hassanien, Aboul ella/O-5672-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,2324-8858,2324-8866,,,,NOV,2016.0,4.0,4,,,,,T427,T441,,10.1190/INT-2015-0223.1,,,,,,,WOS:000388829600009,,,,,,Houston

Downstream pressure changes were measured after increasing and maintaining upstream pressure constant. The initial pressure difference changes only after the pressure pulse propagates across the sample. For low permeability samples, the downstream pressure increase is delayed but the measurement senses a greater sample volume. On the other hand, conventional pulse decay techniques provide a more rapid response but are sensitive to local sample permeability heterogeneity. Permeability measured for the rocks studied varies from 1.18 x 10(-15) to 3.95 x 10(-21) m(2). The measured permeability anisotropy ratio in g as shale varies from 20% to 31%. The magnitudes of permeability anisotropy remain almost constant, but the absolute permeability values decrease by a factor of 10 with a 29.79 MPa effective pressure. All samples showed a nonlinear reduction in permeability with increasing effective pressure. The rate of reduction is markedly different from sample to sample and with flow direction. This reduction can be described by a cubic k-sigma law and explained by preferential flow through microcracks.

In the method through the continuous monitoring of O-3 and CO2 (concentration and flow rate) before and after reaction, COD can be accurately determined. During the experiment, sample solutions with known COD concentration of 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5, and 1 ppm were first used to validate the feasibility of this new technique. These samples were treated under ambient temperature and pressure for 15 min before the complete digestion time for each sample was measured by analyzing the produced CO2 concentration. After digestion, residual O-3 dissolved in solution was quantified by the indigo method. A linear relationship between the O-3 consumption and COD value was observed, and the slope of calibration curve was determined to be 0.34 with a R-2 of 0.991.

We modified the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to include oak pollen emission, dispersion, and deposition. The Oak Pollen Emission Model (OPEM) calculated gridded oak pollen emissions, which are based on a parameterized equation considering a plant-specific factor (C (e) ), surface characteristics, and meteorology. The simulation period was chosen to be February 21 to April 30 in the spring of 2010, when the observed monthly mean oak pollen concentrations were the highest in six years (2009-2014). The results indicated C (e) and meteorology played an important role in the calculation of oak pollen emissions. While C (e) was critical in determining the magnitude of oak pollen emissions, meteorology determined their variability. In particular, the contribution of the meteorology to the variation in oak pollen emissions increased with the oak pollen emission rate. The evaluation results using in-situ surface data revealed that the model underestimated pollen concentrations and was unable to accurately reproduce the peak pollen episodes. The model error was likely due to uncertainty in climatology-based C (e) used for the estimation of oak pollen emissions and inaccuracy in the wind fields from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model.","[Jeon, Wonbae; Choi, Yunsoo; Roy, Anirban; Pan, Shuai] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Price, Daniel] Univ Houston, Honors Coll, Houston, TX USA; [Hwang, Mi-Kyoung] Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Busan, South Korea; [Kim, Kyu Rang] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Appl Meteorol Res Div, Jeju, South Korea; [Oh, Inbo] Univ Ulsan, Ctr Environm Hlth, Coll Med, Ulsan 44033, South Korea","Oh, I (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Ctr Environm Hlth, Coll Med, Ulsan 44033, South Korea.",oinbo@ulsan.ac.kr,,,"Data Analytics in Student Hands Program at the Honors College; Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Houston [HEAF FS 13 NSM CHOI]; Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS Research Grant) of the University of Houston; Environmental Health Center of the Ministry of Environment, Republic of Korea","This study was funded by the Data Analytics in Student Hands Program at the Honors College and the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (HEAF FS 13 NSM CHOI and EAS Research Grant) of the University of Houston.

Change in snow albedo values associated with changing climate conditions can be monitored remotely from satellite platforms viewing the entire Greenland ice sheet, yet comparisons to high quality surface measurements are necessary to assess the accuracy of satellite measurements as new snow albedo algorithms are developed with higher spatial and temporal resolution. During May, June, and July 2011, we obtained daily measurements of spectral albedo at Summit, Greenland with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer, scanning at 350-2200 nm. We compare our spectral albedo field measurements to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), using both the Version 005 Direct Broadcast daily albedo product and the recently developed Version 006 MCD43A daily albedo product. The spectral field measurements allow calculation of weighted integrals to compare to seven MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging the UV through Infrared, as well as a broadband integration to compare to the MODIS shortwave albedo. We additionally compare our field measurements to albedo measured at the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station at Summit. Using the MODIS Version 005 Direct Broadcast product, high-quality retrievals only, comparison to field measurements results in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.033 for the MODIS shortwave product, and RMSE for the MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging 0.022-0.077. The new MODIS Version 006 product shows considerable improvement, with shortwave RMSE of 0.026, and narrow bandwidths ranging 0.020-0.048. These error values for the Version 006 albedo product show an improvement in reported error values from previous MODIS field validations in Greenland, which have been limited to broadband data from the Greenland Climate Network Automatic Weather Stations.

The application of airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) remote sensing provides a detailed raster image that mimics a 3-D view (technically, it is 2.5-D) of a 200 sq km area covering the settlement of Caracol, a long-term occupied (600 BC-A.D. 250-900) Maya archaeological site in Belize, literally ""seeing"" though gaps in the rainforest canopy. Penetrating the encompassing jungle, LiDAR-derived images accurately portray not only the topography of the landscape, but also, structures, causeways, and agricultural terraces even those with relatively low relief of 5-30 cm. These data demonstrate the ability of the ancient Maya to modify, radically, their landscape in order to create a sustainable urban environment. Given the time and intensive effort involved in producing traditional large-scale maps, swath mapping LiDAR is a powerful cost-efficient tool to analyze past settlement and landscape modifications in tropical regions as it covers large study areas in a relatively short time. The use of LiDAR technology, as illustrated here, will ultimately replace traditional settlement mapping in tropical rainforest environments, such as the Maya region, although ground verification will continue to be necessary to test its efficacy.

Various motion compensation (MoCo) procedures have been used in the airborne DInSAR processing to acquire reliable deformation mapping. In this paper, we present the use of time-domain backprojection (BP) algorithm for SAR focusing in an airborne DInSAR survey: No MoCo procedure is needed because the BP algorithm is inherently able to compensate for platform motion. In this study, we present the results of a pilot study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of deformation mapping with an airborne SAR system based on the monitoring of the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado, USA between July 3 and 10 of 2015. The employed airborne SAR system is an Artemis SlimSAR that is a compact, modular, and multi-frequency radar system. Airborne light detection and ranging and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations, as well as spaceborne DInSAR results using COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images, were used to verify the performance of the airborne SAR system. The surface velocities of the landslide derived from the airborne DInSAR observations showed good agreement with the GNSS and spaceborne DInSAR estimates. A three-dimensional deformation map of the Slumgullion landslide was also generated, which displayed distinct correlation between the landslide motion and topographic variation. This study shows that an inexpensive airborne L-band DInSAR system has the potential to measure centimeter level deformation with flexible temporal and spatial baselines.","[Cao, Ning; Lee, Hyongki; Shrestha, Ramesh; Carter, William; Glennie, Craig; Fernandez-Diaz, Juan Carlos] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Cao, Ning; Lee, Hyongki; Shrestha, Ramesh; Carter, William; Glennie, Craig; Fernandez-Diaz, Juan Carlos] Univ Houston, Natl Ctr Airborne Laser Mapping, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Zaugg, Evan] Artemis Inc, Hauppauge, NY 11788 USA; [Wang, Guoquan] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Lu, Zhong] Southern Methodist Univ, Roy M Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75205 USA","Lee, H (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.; Lee, H (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Natl Ctr Airborne Laser Mapping, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",ncao5@uh.edu; hlee@uh.edu; evan@artemisinc.net; rshrest2@Central.UH.EDU; carter4451@bellsouth.net; clglennie@uh.edu; gwang@uh.edu; zhonglu@mail.smu.edu; jfernan4@Central.UH.EDU,,,National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping [NSF EAR-1043051],This work was supported by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping via project NSF EAR-1043051.,"[Anonymous], 2007, COSMO SKYMED SAR PRO; Burgmann R, 2000, ANNU REV EARTH PL SC, V28, P169, DOI 10.1146/annurev.earth.28.1.169; de Macedo KAC, 2008, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V46, P3151, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2008.924004; de Macedo KAC, 2012, IEEE J-STARS, V5, P990, DOI 10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2187275; Coe JA, 2003, ENG GEOL, V68, P67, DOI 10.1016/S0013-7952(02)00199-0; Curlander J.

By introducing damping into the system, we show how the widely used time-marching staggered finite difference (FD) approach in solving elastodynamic wave equation can be used to model time-independent elastostatic problems. The damped FD method can compute elastostatic stress and strain fields of a model subject to the influence of an external field via prescribed boundary conditions. We also show how to obtain an optimized value for the damping factor. We verified the damped FD approach by comparing results against the analytical solutions for a borehole model and a laminated model. We also validated our approach numerically for an inclusion model by comparing the results computed by a finite element method. The damped FD showed excellent agreement with both the analytical results and the finite element results.","[Lin, Rongrong; Fang, Xinding; Gan, Yuandi; Zheng, Yingcai] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Lin, Rongrong; Fang, Xinding] Southern Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Lin, RR (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA.; Lin, RR (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",rlin5@uh.edu; fangxd@sustc.edu.cn,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-1833058]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41704112]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0310105],We thank Professor Leon Thomsen for discussions about the physical meaning of the damping parameter.

704,J,"Souri, AH; Vajedian, S",,,,"Souri, Amir Hossein; Vajedian, Sanaz",,,Dust storm detection using random forests and physical-based approaches over the Middle East,JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dust storms are important phenomena over large regions of the arid and semi-arid areas of the Middle East. Due to the influences of dust aerosols on climate and human daily activities, dust detection plays a crucial role in environmental and climatic studies. Detection of dust storms is critical to accurately understand dust, their properties and distribution. Currently, remotely sensed data such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) with appropriate temporal and spectral resolutions have been widely used for this purpose. This paper investigates the capability of two physical-based methods, and random forests (RF) classifier, for the first time, to detect dust storms using MODIS imagery. Since the physical-based approaches are empirical, they suffer from certain drawbacks such as high variability of thresholds depending on the underlying surface. Therefore, classification-based approaches could be deployed as an alternative. In this paper, the most relevant bands are chosen based on the physical effects of the major classes, particularly dust, cloud and snow, on both emissive infrared and reflective bands. In order to verify the capability of the methods, OMAERUV AAOD (aerosol absorption optical depth) product from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) sensor is exploited. In addition, some small regions are selected manually to be considered as ground truth for measuring the probability of false detection (POFD) and probability of missing detection (POMD). The dust class generated by RF is consistent qualitatively with the location and extent of dust observed in OMERAUV and MODIS true colour images. Quantitatively, the dust classes generated for eight dust outbreaks in the Middle East are found to be accurate from 7% and 6% of POFD and POMD respectively. Moreover, results demonstrate the sound capability of RF in classifying dust plumes over both water and land simultaneously. The performance of the physical-based approaches is found weaker than RF due to empirical thresholds that are not always true.",,,,"Souri, Amir Hossein/AAJ-3725-2020; Souri, Amir Hossein/I-2339-2015","Souri, Amir Hossein/0000-0002-7943-4412; Souri, Amir Hossein/0000-0002-7943-4412",,,,,,,,,,,,2347-4327,0973-774X,,,,JUL,2015.0,124.0,5,,,,,1127,1141,,10.1007/s12040-015-0585-6,,,,,,,WOS:000358329700015,,,,,,Houston

Aerosol size and composition were determined using an Aerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer. Aerosol was dominated by sulfate (4.1 +/- 2.6 mu g m(-3)) and organic material (5.5 +/- 4.0 mu g m(-3)), with contributions of organic material from both primary (similar to 32%) and secondary (similar to 68%) sources. Secondary organic aerosol appears to be formed locally. In addition, 29 aerosol filter samples were analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy to determine relative concentrations of organic functional groups. Houston aerosols are less oxidized than those observed elsewhere, with smaller relative contributions of carbon-oxygen double bonds. These particles do not fit H-1 NMR source apportionment fingerprints for identification of secondary, marine, and biomass burning organic aerosol, suggesting that a new fingerprint for highly urbanized and industrially influenced locations be established.

SST estimates may be biased towards summer temperature in this region, as revealed by a large set of surface sediments. The Holocene records show consistently warmer than present-day SSTs except for the past similar to 0.6 cal ka BP. However, they do not exhibit an early Holocene temperature optimum as registered further north off Chile and in Antarctica. This may have resulted from a combination of factors including decreased inflow of warmer open marine waters due to lower sea-level stands, enhanced advection of colder and fresher inner fjord waters, and stronger westerly winds. During the mid-Holocene, pronounced short-term variations of up to 2.5 degrees C and a cooling centered at similar to 5 cal ka BP, which coincides with the first Neoglacial glacier advance in the Southern Andes, are recorded. The latest Holocene is characterized by two pronounced cold events centered at similar to 0.6 and 0.25 cal ka BP, i.e., during the Little Ice Age. These cold events have lower amplitudes in the offshore records, suggesting an amplification of the SST signal in the inner fjords. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Unraveling their origins is crucial for effective petroleum exploration and exploitation. This is often a challenge because light crudes are volatile, deficient in biomarkers, and commonly altered. The origin of condensates and natural gases in the Upper-Cretaceous Almond Formation in southwestern Wyoming was unraveled through use of improved analytical and interpretative geochemical approaches constrained by regional geologic perspectives and basin modeling. Here, an improved GC-MS/MS method allowed simultaneous determination of saturate and aromatic biomarkers, diamondoids, and organo-sulfur compounds in the whole crudes. Furthermore, basin-specific calibration of diamondoid-based thermal maturity parameters, through correlation of measured indices for diamondoids in rock extracts versus measured reflectance of vitrinite from the same rocks, allowed reliable interpretation of maturity of the most likely source rocks. Modified interpretation schemes for C-7-hydrocarbon distributions, and compositions of C-1-C-30 alkanes, aromatic and organosulfur compounds, and delta C-13(1)-C-5 together indicated that the condensate and natural gas from each well are likely co-generated and thermogenic products from non-marine source rocks, although methane is partially biogenic. The bulk thermogenic petroleum are too mature to have originated in the rocks adjacent to the producing reservoirs. The geochemical, geologic, and modeling interpretations collectively indicate that the condensates and associated natural gases were most likely generated, expelled, and migrated from the downdip, highly mature, near-shore/transitional humic source rocks of the Almond Formation/Mesaverde Group in the Washakie Basin and Great Divide Basin at > 1.3% Ro and similar to 30 Ma.

A detailed evaluation of the density and velocity trends revealed that in the northern part of the Louisiana shelf, unloading is the major mechanism of overpressure. The onset of overpressure occurs at depths around 3000 m where temperatures are normally greater than 70 degrees C. The relationship of the temperature gradient increase and the velocity decrease to the smectite-illite transformation allowed us to believe that inelastic unloading may be the major mechanism for overpressure in this region. On the other hand, in the southern part of the Louisiana shelf, abnormal pore pressure is often caused by compaction disequilibrium where the sediment section has a low sand percentage. In this type of pressure regime, velocity and density values cease to change at the onset of overpressure and essentially remain at the same value below the onset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2324-8858,2324-8866,,,,FEB,2014.0,2.0,1,,,,,SB1,+,,10.1190/INT-2013-0067.1,,,,,,,WOS:000364201900023,,,,,,Houston

Part I: Enhanced separation and quantification of saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes (SARA)",ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Compositional analysis of crude oils is very important along the entire value chain of the oil industry, from upstream to midstream and downstream operations. An essential step of this analysis is to separate crude oil into fractions of saturate hydrocarbon (saturates), aromatic hydrocarbon (aromatics), resins, and asphaltenes (SARA). Though a number of methods have been developed for SARA separation, traditional methods involve significant drawbacks that include, but are not limited to, inconsistent results among labs and methods, extensive cross-contamination, and poor analytical precision. Here, we report on a novel automated multi-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography (AMD-HPLC) approach to enhance group-type characterization of crude oil or bitumen. The AMD-HPLC system is fully automated and developed based on a combination of adsorption and partition chromatography. It is equipped with a cyano column and a silica column. Each set of SARA columns is connected in series via multi-position valves that allow a given column to be inserted ""in"" or to be bypassed ""out"" of the flow path of the mobile phase at pre-set times in the process. In practice, a bitumen or oil sample of 0.02 g is dissolved in a solvent mixture of 15% methanol, 15% acetone, and 70% chloroform, and injected into the instrument. The sample is fractionated into the four groups by selective retention through interactions with the solvent mobile phases and the column substrates. The instrument then resets and is ready to start the next run. The entire analysis cycle requires about 60 min per run, including system reconditioning. Based on its wide application at our laboratory, the AMD-HPLC is characterized by high efficiency, elimination of cross-contamination, and high reproducibility - when compared to traditional methods.

Individual receiver functions were stacked according to ray piercing points with moveout corrections in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the converted S-to-P phases. A mantle discontinuity, which is interpreted as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), is observed along the profile with depth ranging from 80 km beneath the Rio Grande Rift (RGR) to 100 km beneath the Great Plains (GP) and 120-180 km beneath the Colorado Plateau (CP). The shallow LAB beneath the Rio Grande Rift is indicative of lithosphere extension and asthenosphere upwarp. The LAB deepens sharply at the RGR-CP and RGR-GP boundaries, providing evidence for edge-driven, small-scale mantle convection beneath LA RISTRA. Two local discontinuities beneath the southeastern Colorado Plateau are imaged at similar to 250 km and similar to 300 km and could be the top and base of the eroded lithosphere, respectively. The S receiver function images suggest that edge-driven, small-scale convection is probably the mantle source for recent extension and uplift in the Rio Grande Rift and the Colorado Plateau.

Drilling in both areas ended in dolerites inferred to be sheeted intrusive rocks. The basalts apparently erupted immediately after subduction initiation and have compositions similar to those of the most depleted basalts generated by rapid sea-floor spreading at mid-ocean ridges, with little or no slab input. Subsequent melting to generate boninites involved more depleted mantle and hotter and deeper subducted components as subduction progressed and volcanism migrated away from the trench. This volcanic sequence is akin to that recorded by many ophiolites, supporting a direct link between subduction initiation, fore-arc spreading, and ophiolite genesis.","[Reagan, Mark K.] Univ Iowa, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Pearce, Julian A.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Petronotis, Katerina] Texas A&M Univ, Int Ocean Discovery Program, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Almeev, Renat R.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mineral, Hannover, Germany; [Avery, Aaron J.] Florida State Univ, Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Carvallo, Claire] Univ Paris 06, Inst Mineral Phys Mat & Cosmochim, Paris, France; [Chapman, Timothy] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Christeson, Gail L.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX USA; [Ferre, Eric C.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Geol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Godard, Marguerite] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Geosci Montpellier, Montpellier, France; [Heaton, Daniel E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvalis, OR USA; [Kirchenbaur, Maria] Univ Cologne, Geol Inst, Cologne, Germany; [Kurz, Walter] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Earth Sci, Graz, Austria; [Kutterolf, Steffen] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Kiel, Germany; [Li, Hongyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Isotope Geochem, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Yibing] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Michibayashi, Katsuyoshi] Shizuoka Univ, Inst Geosci, Shizuoka, Japan; [Morgan, Sally] Univ Leicester, Dept Geol, Leicester, Leics, England; [Nelson, Wendy R.] Towson Univ, Dept Phys Astron & Geosci, Towson, MD USA; [Prytulak, Julie] Imperial Coll London, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London, England; [Python, Marie] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Robertson, Alastair H.

D.; Mayer, B.; Humayun, M.",,,s-Process Os isotope enrichment in ureilites by planetary processing,EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ubiquitous nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies relative to the terrestrial isotopic composition in Mo, Ru, and other elements are known from both bulk chondrites and differentiated meteorites, but Os isotope ratios reported from such meteorites have been found to be indistinguishable from the terrestrial value. The carriers of s- and r-process Os must thus have been homogeneously distributed in the solar nebula. As large Os isotope anomalies are known from acid leachates and residues of primitive chondrites, the constant relative proportions of presolar s- and r-process carriers in such chondrites must have been maintained during nebular processes. It has long been assumed that partial melting of primitive chondrites would homogenize the isotopic heterogeneity carried by presolar grains. Here, ureilites, carbon-rich ultramafic achondrites dominantly composed of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene, are shown to be the first differentiated bulk Solar System materials for which nucleosynthetic Os isotope anomalies have been identified. These anomalies consist of enrichment in s-process Os heterogeneously distributed in different ureilites. Given the observed homogeneity of Os isotopes in all types of primitive chondrites, this Os isotope variability among ureilites must have been caused by selective removal of s-process-poor Os host phases, probably metal, during rapid localized melting on the ureilite parent body. While Mo and Ru isotope anomalies for all meteorites measured so far exhibit s-process deficits relative to the Earth, the opposite holds for the Os isotope anomalies in ureilites reported here. This might indicate that the Earth preferentially accreted olivine-rich restites and inherited a s-process excess relative to smaller meteorite bodies, consistent with Earth's high Mg/Si ratio and enrichment of s-process nuclides in Mo, Ru, and Nd isotopes. Our new Os isotope results imply that caution must be used when applying nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as provenance indicators between different classes of meteorites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The microbes and their by-products in the nucleus induced the precipitation of carbonate, overcoming the inhibition to initiate crystal formation. The enveloping radiating crystals comprising aragonitic cortices tended to grow abiotically producing well-formed euhedral crystals with a paucity of included bacterial fossils. Whereas those cortical crystals made-up of calcite commonly contained bacterial fossils, indicating that the bacterial colonies contributed to the calcitic cortical crystal precipitation. Similar spherulites form a thick, widespread accumulation in the Aptian Pre-Salt lacustrine deposits in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. As with the travertine, tufa, and caliche spherulites, the Pre-Salt spherulites most likely initiated carbonate precipitation around bacterial colonies and/or their bioproducts, probably while afloat in a lacustrine water column before settling to the water-sediment interface. Absence of inter-spherulite sediment and the spherulite-to-spherulite compaction indicate that cortical crystal growth continued while the spherulites were at the sediment-water interface rather than displacively within a sediment.

Despite the potential information that this sedimentary record may bear on the evolution of tropical intramontane siliciclastic successions along active Andean type convergent margins, little is known about its provenance. Here we document petrographic, heavy mineral and detrital zircon U-Pb ages data from the Amaga Formation, cropping out along the Santa Fe de Antioquia - San Jeronimo Sub-Basin, from which we investigate the evolution and controlling factors leading to changes in its provenance. Sandstones from the late Oligocene Lower Member of the Amaga Formation display compositional modes and U-Pb detrital zircon ages which suggest sediment sources exclusively associated to the continental South American Plate. The compositional modes and detrital zircon U-Pb ages of sandstones from the early - middle Miocene Upper Member suggest, instead, sediment sources associated to both, the South American Plate and the allochthonous Panama-Choco Block. In particular, the Upper Member documents the arrival of detrital zircons younger than 50 Ma (18.7, 21.0, 25.3, 31.9, 40.7, 45.1 Ma), which are not present in the South American Plate. This change in provenance parallels a change in sedimentary environments, from meandering (Lower Member) to braided (Upper Member) rivers, which have been interpreted as a major decrease in sediment accommodation space along the northern Andes. This decrease in accommodation space is associated to a regional accelerated uplift in the northern Andes resulting from the early Miocene accretion of the Panama-Choco Block to northern South America.

Circular gravity anomaly lows, and magnetic anomaly highs, over the center of spreading ridge segments are interpreted as large volcanic centers that erupted within a late Jurassic-to-earliest Cretaceous, slow-spreading center. Detailed mapping of oceanic basement using oil industry seismic data indicates that the EGOM oceanic ridge system is characterized by 30-60-km-long spreading ridge segments, that include 15-km-wide, 2-km-high axial volcanoes in their centers, and nodal basins at their ends. Stratigraphic evidence from seismic reflection data tied to a deepwater well indicates that volcanism along the spreading ridge ended around the same time (Berriasian), or slightly after (Valanginian), the cessation of seafloor spreading in the EGOM. Flowlines of late Jurassic-to-earliest Cretaceous seafloor, based on a pole of rotation from the geometry of GOM spreading ridges and fracture zones, show a good match with gravity and magnetic anomalies along the Florida and Yucatan conjugate margins of the EGOM. Mapping of age-dated, stratigraphic downlaps onto the oceanic crust is consistent with an interpreted ridge jump at the beginning of seafloor spreading (Kimmeridgian) to the southwest, and in the same southwestward direction of a previously inferred mantle plume in the central GOM. Our 3-D gravity structural inversion of the Moho requires 6.4 km thick oceanic crust in the northwestern EGOM, and 5.5 km thick oceanic crust in southeastern EGOM. We interpret this along-ridge, thickness variation to reflect faster spreading and thicker oceanic crust farther from the opening pole located in the southeastern GOM.","[Lin, Pin; Bird, Dale E.; Mann, Paul] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Bird, Dale E.] Bird Geophys, Houston, TX 77084 USA; [Lin, Pin] CNOOC China Ltd Beijing, Res Inst, Beijing 100001, Peoples R China","Lin, P (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA.; Lin, P (corresponding author), CNOOC China Ltd Beijing, Res Inst, Beijing 100001, Peoples R China.",slyzlinpin@163.com,"Mann, Paul/AAH-5475-2019","Mann, Paul/0000-0002-1158-1280","Conjugate Basins, Tectonics, and Hydrocarbons Consortium at the University of Houston","We thank Mike Saunders at Spectrum Geo for providing the extensive, 2D grid of seismic reflection data that was critical for this study and for providing us permission to publish these results.

The comparisons between observations and model simulations suggest that most CMIP5 models capture two main characteristics of the recycling rate: 1) long-term decreasing trend of the global-average maritime recycling rate (atmospheric recycling rate over ocean within 608S-608N) and 2) dominant spatial patterns of the temporal variations of the recycling rate (i.e., increasing in the intertropical convergence zone and decreasing in subtropical regions). All models, except one, successfully simulate not only the long-term trend but also the interannual variability of column water vapor. The simulations of precipitation are relatively poor, especially over the relatively short time scales, which lead to the discrepancy of the recycling rate between observations and the CMIP5 models. Comparisons of spatial patterns also suggest that the CMIP5 models simulate column water vapor better than precipitation. The comparative studies indicate the scope of improvement in the simulations of precipitation, especially for the relatively short-time-scale variations, to better simulate the recycling rate of atmospheric moisture, an important indicator of climate change.","[Kao, Angela; Jiang, Xun; Trammell, James H.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Li, Liming] Univ Houston, Dept Phys, Houston, TX USA; [Zhang, Guang J.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, Climate Atmospher Sci & Phys Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA USA; [Su, Hui; Jiang, Jonathan H.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Div Sci, Pasadena, CA USA; [Yung, Yuk L.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Jiang, X (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",xjiang7@uh.edu,,"Li, Liming/0000-0002-5257-9849","NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX13AC04G, NNX13AK34G]; NASA NEWS project; NASA ROSES program [NNH15ZDA001N-PDART]; National Science Foundation GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-1549259]","XJ and YLY were supported by NASA Grants NNX13AC04G and NNX13AK34G.

Faulting patterns can range from either being distributed to highly localized. Observations indicate that the factors controlling the extensional deformation, symmetry, and fault spacing include rheological aspects such as the yielding mechanism and strain softening, and physical aspects such as initial heterogeneities and the strength of the lower crust compared to the upper crust. Time-dependent numerical models of extension are presented, which investigate the influence of the yielding mechanism, lower crust strength, strain weakening, and initial heterogeneity in the crust have on (a) the style of rifting, (b) fault spacing, and (c) integrated strength in the upper crust. Models with an anisotropic yielding mechanism result in more realistic lithospheric strength profiles, slip plane angle distributions, and fault interaction than models with an isotropic yielding mechanism. Heterogeneity type and yielding mechanisms have the largest effect on the resulting symmetry of deformation, whereas the amount of strain weakening has the greatest influence on asymmetry. The likelihood of the metamorphic core complex mode occurring is primarily controlled by lower crust strength. Crustal thinning is encouraged by both low amounts of strain weakening and a strong lower crust. Lower crust viscosity exerts the primary control on whether the resulting deformation is distributed or localized. The degree of strain weakening has the largest influence on the average strength of the upper crust and the slope of the strength profile in the upper crust.",,,,,"Moresi, Louis/0000-0003-3685-174X",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9313,2169-9356,,,,JUN,2015.0,120.0,6,,,,,4379,4404,,10.1002/2014JB011813,,,,,,,WOS:000357993000022,,,,,,Houston

The study analyzed several rock samples for gold concentrations. These analyses found gold concentrations of up to 96 ppm in sulfide-mineralization zones in the Astore area. Several rock samples were scanned using visible-near and shortwave infrared hyperspectral sensors. Comparison of different datasets provided a method for evaluating spatial distribution of minerals in the samples. Dominant minerals in the alteration zone included galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and azurite. The high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data were evaluated using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Although SVM yielded fewer unclassified pixels, SAM gave superior classification results and distribution estimates, particularly for sulfide minerals, which exhibit lower overall reflectance profiles. The surface mineral distribution estimates obtained from SAM are in a very good agreement with electron microscope data.","[Khan, Shuhab D.; Okyay, Unal] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Ahmad, Laeiq] Univ Swabi, Dept Geol, Anbar, Khybar Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Shah, Mohammad T.] FATA Univ, Akhurwal, Khybar Pakhtunk, Pakistan","Khan, SD (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",sdkhan@uh.edu,"Khan, Shuhab D/C-6839-2008; Okyay, Unal/H-5736-2019","Khan, Shuhab D/0000-0002-3848-8190; Okyay, Unal/0000-0001-8360-2602",National Academy of Sciences; Higher Education Commission of PakistanHigher Education Commission of Pakistan; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1256202],"The National Academy of Sciences and the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, through Pak-US Science and Technology Cooperation Program, funded this research.

Several studies have shown the development of coatings with multifuctionality in DI water but have negleted the effects of water chemistry, shelf-life and chemical regeneration of these nanocomposite coatings for the simultaneous removal of different biological and chemical water contaminants. This nanocomposite was selected for this investigation since it showed a broad removal capability. This nanocomposite showed removals of Cr (VI), Cu(II), and Pb(II) over 90% at 1 ppm initial concentration and nitrate > 75% at 20 ppm initial concentration under DI water. Furthermore, the coated filters were effective in removing > 3 logs of E. coli K12, B. subtilis, and P. aeruginosa. The integrity and performance of the modified filters were investigated against a wide range of water chemistries with different pH values, salinity, and total hardness. For water chemistries with pH 4-9, salinity 50-1000 ppm, and total hardness of 50-500 ppm as CaCO3, at least one tested contaminant showed similar percentage removals indicating the potential use of the modified filters in these large ranges of water chemistry conditions. Based on that, the filters were used to treat representative samples of wastewater and seawater. The coated filters were able to remove suspended particles, bacteria, and heavy metals effectively. Later the potential for regeneration and the shelf-life of the coated filters were also investigated. For the regeneration, only 0.1M HCl was able to desorb up to 40% of the adsorbed heavy metal, indicating that the filter can be partially regenerated. Accelerated experiments of shelf-life demonstrated that the modified filters lose their optimum performance around 9-12 months, indicating their potential for short-term storage without any specific preservation conditions.","[Bandara, Pasan Chinthana; Nadres, Enrico Tapire; Pena-Bahamonde, Janire; Rodrigues, Debora F.] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Rodrigues, DF (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",dfrigirodrigues@uh.edu,,,"US Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamationthrough the Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development Program [R16AC00123]; NPRP from the Qatar National Research Fund (Qatar Foundation) [9-318-1-064]; CBET NSF Career grant [1150255]; NSF BEINM Grant [1705511]; Welch foundationThe Welch Foundation [E-2011-20190330]","This work was funded by the US Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamationthrough the Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development Program (Agreement No. R16AC00123); NPRP grant number: 9-318-1-064 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation); CBET NSF Career grant number: 1150255; NSF BEINM Grant Number: 1705511, and the Welch foundation award number (E-2011-20190330).","Adeleye AS, 2016, CHEM ENG J, V286, P640, DOI 10.1016/j.cej.2015.10.105; Ahn K.M., 2018, WATER, V10; Akhavan O, 2010, ACS NANO, V4, P5731, DOI 10.1021/nn101390x; [Anonymous], 816F09004 USEPA; Asano H.L.B.

We tested inversion for fracture compliance matrix components from wide azimuth noisy synthetic PP-reflection data. The model was a fractured reservoir with monoclinic symmetry, formed by two sets of vertical asymmetric fractures embedded in a VTI background. The fractures (joints) were assumed to be vertical, with noncircular shape and/or with asymmetric shear compliance. Results of synthetic inversion showed that an incorrect assumption about fracture shear symmetry (e. g., treating asymmetric fractures as rotationally invariant fractures) can cause considerable error in estimation of the fracture compliance matrix. Components of effective second-and fourth-rank fracture compliance matrices for a medium with monoclinic symmetry (which takes into account layering and multiple fracture sets) can be used as attributes related to the characteristics of the fractured medium. Monte Carlo simulation was used to test the effect of uncertainties in the a priori information (about background VTI parameters of unfractured rock), as they affect inversion for these attributes. According to this analysis, the direction of fast shear-wave polarization was inverted robustly in the Monte Carlo simulation. Although the average values of the components of fracture compliance matrices obtained from Monte Carlo simulation were in agreement with the actual values used for forward modeling, individual values obtained in Monte Carlo simulation were sensitive to uncertainties in the background properties in general. Because the elastic properties of background VTI media without fractures (or other azimuthally variable features) do not cause azimuthal changes in reflection coefficient variation with offset, simultaneous inversion for background properties and fracture tensor components require additional constraints.",,,,"Sayers, Colin M/D-5340-2009","Sayers, Colin M/0000-0002-2839-4238",,,,,,,,,,,,0016-8033,,,,,MAR-APR,2013.0,78.0,2,,,,,N1,N10,,10.1190/GEO2012-0319.1,,,,,,,WOS:000319858000020,,,,,,Houston

Magmas which stagnate and partially crystallize during their rise from the mantle provide a means to constrain the depth of circulation because assimilation of hydrothermal fluids or hydrothermally altered country rock will raise their chlorine (Cl) contents. Here we present Cl concentrations in combination with chemical thermobarometry data on glassy basaltic rocks and melt inclusions from the Southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (SMAR; similar to 3 cm year(-1) full spreading rate) and the Gakkel Ridge (max. 1.5 cm year(-1) full spreading rate) in order to define the depth and extent of chlorine contamination. Basaltic glasses show Cl-contents ranging from ca. 50-430 ppm and ca. 40-700 ppm for the SMAR and Gakkel Ridge, respectively, whereas SMAR melt inclusions contain between 20 and 460 ppm Cl. Compared to elements of similar mantle incompatibility (e.g. K, Nb), Cl-excess (Cl/Nb or Cl/K higher than normal mantle values) of up to 250 ppm in glasses and melt inclusions are found in 75% of the samples from both ridges. Cl-excess is interpreted to indicate assimilation of hydrothermal brines (as opposed to bulk altered rock or seawater) based on the large range of Cl/K ratios in samples showing a limited spread in H2O contents. Resorption and disequilibrium textures of olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocrysts and an abundance of xenocrysts and gabbroic fragments in the SMAR lavas suggest multiple generations of crystallization and assimilation of hydrothermally altered rocks that contain these brines. Calculated pressures of last equilibration based on the major element compositions of melts cannot provide reliable estimates of the depths at which this crystallization/assimilation occurred as the assimilation negates the assumption of crystallization under equilibrium conditions implicit in such calculations. Clinopyroxene-melt thermobarometry on rare clinopyroxene phenocrysts present in the SMAR magmas yield lower crustal crystallization/assimilation depths (10-13 km in the segment containing clinopyroxene). The Cl-excesses in SMAR melt inclusions indicate that assimilation occurred before crystallization, while also homogeneous Cl in melts from Gakkel Ridge indicate Cl addition during magma chamber processes. Combined, these observations imply that hydrothermal circulation reaches the lower crust at slow-spreading ridges, and thereby promotes cooling of the lower crust. The generally lower Cl-excess at slow-spreading ridges (compared to fast-spreading ridges) is probably related to them having few if any permanent magma chambers. Magmas therefore do not fractionate as extensively in the crust, providing less heat for assimilation (on average, slow-spreading ridge magmas have higher Mg#), and hydrothermal systems are ephemeral, leading to lower total degrees of crustal alteration and more variation in the amount of Cl contamination. Hydrothermal plumes and vent fields have samples in close vicinity that display Cl-excess, mostly of > 25 ppm, which thus can aid as a guide for the exploration of (active or extinct) hydrothermal vent fields on the axis.","[van der Zwan, Froukje M.; Devey, Colin W.; Hansteen, Thor H.; Augustin, Nico; Frische, Matthias] Geomar Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Almeev, Renat R.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mineral, Hannover, Germany; [Haase, Karsten M.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, GeoZentrum Nordbayern, Erlangen, Germany; [Basaham, Ali] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Snow, Jonathan E.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX USA","van der Zwan, FM (corresponding author), Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Geowissensch, Kiel, Germany.",fzwan@geomar.de,"Augustin, Nico/Z-1422-2018; Hansteen, Thor/M-2987-2019; Almeev, Renat/D-6171-2015; Devey, Colin/I-3898-2016","Hansteen, Thor/0000-0003-1991-5107; Almeev, Renat/0000-0003-0652-9469; Devey, Colin/0000-0002-0930-7274; van der Zwan, Froukje Marieke/0000-0002-3637-8609","King Abdulaziz University; Helmholtz-Center for Ocean Research GEOMAR; King Abdulaziz University (KAU) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [T-065/430]","We are very grateful to Mario Thoner for the extensive technical assistance at the EMP and to Dagmar Rau for the technical assistance at the LA-ICP-MS.

Average large-scale infiltration and redistribution in heterogeneous soils were quantified through multiple simulations of local-scale processes. The effective hydraulic parameters were derived to simulate the average amount of infiltrating water, and to capture the subsequent surface soil moisture redistribution averaged over the large heterogeneous landscape. The results demonstrated that the effective hydraulic parameters typically exhibited a step change from infiltration to redistribution, with the size of the step change being related to the degree of hydraulic parameter heterogeneity and the correlations among the hydraulic parameters. However, the effective hydraulic parameters did not change significantly over time for the moisture redistribution. It was further demonstrated that the size of the step change was smallest for effective saturated hydraulic conductivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0262-6667,,,,,,2012.0,57.0,6,,,,,1196,1206,,10.1080/02626667.2012.693613,,,,,,,WOS:000307640400012,,,,,,Houston

In the procedure, out-of-focus flocs are automatically removed from the dataset to attain a more precise floc size distribution. This automated technique was tested against visual inspection of images to ensure that the procedure was only selecting in-focus flocs for inclusion in the size measurements, and the resulting measured sizes were compared to floc measured through manual image processing of the same data. The results show that the automated method is able to accurately measure the floc size distribution by correctly sizing in-focus flocs and removing out-of-focus flocs. The processing procedures were developed with sizing of suspended mud flocs in mind, but the process is general and can be applied for other applications. We show the ability of the method to handle large numbers of images (over 15,000 at a time) by tracking the change in floc size population with time at 1-min intervals over the course of a 160 min floc growth experiment.

Secondary HONO production rate as high as 1.1 ppb hr(-1) can be estimated from this approach, based on measurements made during the Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors campaign in May of 2009. We argue, however, that the PSS assumption might not have been valid because the transport time from nearby NOx emission sources to the measurement site was likely less than the time required for HONO in vehicle exhaust to reach PSS. Using a chemical box model, we demonstrate that there is initially net HONO formation as high levels of NO in exhaust react with ambient OH. Net production is followed by a period of net HONO loss dominated by photolysis that is sustained for several minutes to hours depending on time of day. The presence of relatively fresh exhaust in sampled air can partially, if not fully, account for the observed measurement PSS discrepancy. We also show that a large fraction of the observed nighttime increase in HONO/NOx ratio is explained by NO2 oxidation. These results do not rule out the existence of an unexplained secondary HONO source but suggest that great care must be exercised when applying the PSS method to quantify its strength.",,,,"Lefer, Barry/X-9091-2019; Munger, J William/H-4502-2013; Luke, Winston/D-1594-2016; Lee, Ben H/G-7007-2014","Lefer, Barry/0000-0001-9520-5495; Munger, J William/0000-0002-1042-8452; Luke, Winston/0000-0002-1993-2241; Lee, Ben H/0000-0002-5057-2168",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,16-Nov,2013.0,118.0,21,,,,,12274,12281,,10.1002/2013JD020341,,,,,,,WOS:000330611800028,,,,,,Houston

Similar to other enriched and intermediate poikilitic shergottites, NWA 10169 is a cumulate rock that exhibits a bimodal texture characterized by large pyroxene oikocrysts (poikilitic texture) surrounded by olivine-rich interstitial material (non-poikilitic texture). Olivine chadacrysts and pyroxene oikocrysts have higher Mg#s (molar Mg/Mg + Fe) than those in the interstitial areas, suggesting that the poikilitic texture represents early-stage crystallization and accumulation, as opposed to late-stage non-poikilitic (i.e., interstitial material) crystallization. Calculated oxygen fugacity values are more reduced (FMQ -2.3 +/- 0.2) within the poikilitic regions, and more oxidized (FMQ -1.1 +/- 0.1) within the interstitial areas, likely representing auto-oxidation and degassing during magma crystallization. Calculated parental melt compositions using olivine-hosted melt inclusions display a dichotomy between K-poor and K-rich melts, thus possibly indicating mixing of parental melt with K-rich melt. The Lu-176-Hf-176 crystallization age for NWA 10169 is 167 +/- 31 Ma, consistent with the ages reported for other enriched shergottites. Based on the isochron initial Hf-176/Hf-177 value, the modeled source Lu-176/Hf-177 composition for NWA 10169 is 0.02748 +/- 0.00037, identical within uncertainty to the source compositions of the enriched shergottites Shergotty, Zagami, LAR 06319, NWA 4468, and Roberts Massif (RBT) 04262, suggesting a shared, long-lived geochemical source, and distinct from the source of other enriched shergottites Los Angeles, NWA 856, and NWA 7320. This study reveals that at least two sources are responsible for the enriched shergottites, and that the martian mantle is more heterogeneous than previously thought. Additionally, the enriched shergottites, which share a source with NWA 10169, have consistent crystallization ages and magmatic histories, indicating that a common magmatic system on Mars is likely responsible for the formation of this group.

Simultaneous measurements of the physical and chemical properties of snow were carried out at Summit Camp, Greenland (72 degrees 36' N, 38 degrees 25' W, 3210m a.s.l.) in May and June 2011, along with spectral albedo measurements. One of the main objectives of the field campaign was to test our ability to predict snow spectral albedo by comparing the measured albedo to the albedo calculated with a radiative transfer model, using measured snow physical and chemical properties. To achieve this goal, we made daily measurements of the snow spectral albedo in the range 350-2200 nm and recorded snow stratigraphic information down to roughly 80 cm. The snow specific surface area (SSA) was measured using the DUFISSS instrument (DUal Frequency Integrating Sphere for Snow SSA measurement, Gallet et al., 2009). Samples were also collected for chemical analyses including black carbon (BC) and dust, to evaluate the impact of light absorbing particulate matter in snow. This is one of the most comprehensive albedo-related data sets combining chemical analysis, snow physical properties and spectral albedo measurements obtained in a polar environment. The surface albedo was calculated from density, SSA, BC and dust profiles using the DISORT model (DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al., 1988) and compared to the measured values. Results indicate that the energy absorbed by the snowpack through the whole spectrum considered can be inferred within 1.10 %. This accuracy is only slightly better than that which can be obtained considering pure snow, meaning that the impact of impurities on the snow albedo is small at Summit. In the near infrared, minor deviations in albedo up to 0.014 can be due to the accuracy of radiation and SSA measurements and to the surface roughness, whereas deviations up to 0.05 can be explained by the spatial heterogeneity of the snowpack at small scales, the assumption of spherical snow grains made for DISORT simulations and the vertical resolution of measurements of surface layer physical properties. At 1430 and around 1800 nm the discrepancies are larger and independent of the snow properties; we propose that they are due to errors in the ice refractive index at these wavelengths. This work contributes to the development of physically based albedo schemes in detailed snowpack models, and to the improvement of retrieval algorithms for estimating snow properties from remote sensing data.",,,,"Dumont, Marie/M-7971-2017; Dumont, Marie/R-4507-2019; Picard, Ghislain/D-4246-2013; Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011","Dumont, Marie/0000-0002-4002-5873; Dumont, Marie/0000-0002-4002-5873; Picard, Ghislain/0000-0003-1475-5853; Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X; libois, quentin/0000-0001-8963-4170; Wright, Patrick/0000-0003-2999-9076; arnaud, laurent/0000-0002-4432-4205",,,,,,,,,,,,1994-0416,1994-0424,,,,,2013.0,7.0,4,,,,,1139,1160,,10.5194/tc-7-1139-2013,,,,,,,WOS:000323985700010,,,,,,Houston

These observations have revealed important CO2 variability at different timescales and over regional and planetary scales. Satellite CO2 retrievals have revealed that stratospheric sudden warming and the Madden-Julian Oscillation can modulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the mid-troposphere. Atmospheric CO2 also demonstrates variability at interannual timescales. In the tropical region, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Tropospheric Biennial Oscillation can change atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At high latitudes, mid-tropospheric CO2 concentrations can be influenced by the Northern Hemispheric annular mode. In addition to modulations by the largescale circulations, sporadic events such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and droughts, which change CO2 surface emissions, can cause atmospheric CO2 concentrations to increase significantly. The natural variability of CO2 summarized in this review can help us better understand its sources and sinks and its redistribution by atmospheric motion. Global satellite CO2 data offer a unique opportunity to explore CO2 variability in different regions. Atmospheric CO2 concentration demonstrates variations at intraseasonal, seasonal, and interannual timescales.

They are widespread and well developed in large areas of Texas. A majority are of late Quaternary age and have formed across a range of climatic conditions on various types of substrates. To evaluate the usefulness of pedogenic carbonates as environmental indicators, this study investigates regional-scale trends in stable-isotope compositions of pedogenic carbonates across approximately 900 km of Texas. The delta C-13 values of 49 pedogenic carbonate profiles (182 analyses) on various host strata (e.g., limestone, igneous rocks), range from - 10.6 parts per thousand to +0.7 parts per thousand V-PDB. Most delta C-13 values are evenly distributed between -9 parts per thousand and -1 parts per thousand, and the delta O-18 values range from -9.1 parts per thousand to +0.2 parts per thousand V-PDB, mainly between -6 parts per thousand and -2 parts per thousand. There is no correlation between carbon and oxygen isotopic values (R-2 = 0.0002). Pedogenic carbonates in the Texas Gulf Coastal Plains, Southern High Plains, and west Texas exhibit higher delta C-13 values than those in south and central Texas, which corresponds to the spatial change in vegetation between C-4-dominated and C-3-dominated plants. The marked increase in delta C-13 values of the pedogenic carbonates from the Tertiary strata into the overlying Quaternary strata confirms the invasion of a C-4 biomass into the Southern High Plains since the early Pliocene. From east to west, the delta O-18 values of late Quaternary pedogenic carbonates decrease gradually, a trend that mimics the spatial variation of delta O-18 values of modern meteoric water primarily due to the increased distance from the Gulf of Mexico (source of most of the meteoric water). In contrast to the regional trends, the stable-isotope values of some pedogenic carbonates developed on marine limestone and calcareous alluvium in central Texas and south Texas have isotopic signatures inherited from the host strata. In addition, some of the delta C-13 values of pedogenic carbonate nodules in the Gulf Coastal Plains have been affected by saline groundwater. Soil carbonates formed in the shallow parts of the profile, such as petrocalcic horizons, may have also been influenced by the atmospheric CO2. Nevertheless, climatic trends are readily apparent in the isotopic data, thus demonstrating their potential value in region-wide paleoclimatic analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1527-1404,1938-3681,,,,JAN-FEB,2010.0,80.0,2-Jan,,,,,137,150,,10.2110/jsr.2010.018,,,,,,,WOS:000274172100011,,,,,,Houston

Mutual thin-bed interference modeling suited for the case study area was performed using a well-tying well-based extracted wavelet assumed to be representative of the wavelet embedded on the input seismic data. The long coda of this wavelet is also present on the corresponding thin-bed waveform, indicating the possibility of more complex mutual interference patterns between thin beds and mutual interference at farther vertical separations between thin beds compared with what would occur for an embedded wavelet with a shorter coda The observed lateral changes on preferential frequency and phase illumination on the seismic data are attributable to collocated lateral changes in the stacking patterns and variable occurrence of vertically adjacent thin beds, which are interpreted as lateral sediment deposition changes induced by the syndepositional activity of the secondary faults.

It is anticipated that signal acquisition with random projections will decrease signal-sensing costs significantly; moreover, it has been demonstrated that both supervised and unsupervised statistical learning algorithms work reliably within randomly projected subspaces. Capitalizing on this latter development, several class-dependent strategies are proposed for the reconstruction of hyperspectral imagery from random projections. In this approach, each hyperspectral pixel is first classified into one of several pixel groups using either a conventional supervised classifier or an unsupervised clustering algorithm. After the grouping procedure, a suitable reconstruction method, such as compressive projection principal component analysis, is employed independently within each group. Experimental results confirm that such class-dependent reconstruction, which employs statistics pertinent to each class as opposed to the global statistics estimated over the entire data set, results in more accurate reconstructions of hyperspectral pixels from random projections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0196-2892,,,,,FEB,2013.0,51.0,2,,,,,833,843,,10.1109/TGRS.2012.2204759,,,,,,,WOS:000314019500010,,,,,,Houston

Chemical species including hydroxyl and peroxy radicals (OH and HO2 + RO2), ozone (O-3), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitric acid (HNO3), nitrous acid (HONO), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), and bromine oxide (BrO) were measured during the campaign. The median midday values of HO2 + RO2 and OH concentrations observed by chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) were 2.7x10(8) molec cm(-3) and 3.0x10(6) molec cm(-3) in spring 2007, and 4.2x10(8) molec cm(-3) and 4.1x10(6) molec cm(-3) in summer 2008. A basic photochemical 0-D box model highly constrained by observations of H2O, O-3, CO, CH4, NO, and J values predicted HO2 + RO2 (R = 0.90, slope = 0.87 in 2007; R = 0.79, slope = 0.96 in 2008) reasonably well and under predicted OH (R = 0.83, slope = 0.72 in 2007; R = 0.76, slope = 0.54 in 2008). Constraining the model to HONO observations did not significantly improve the ratio of OH to HO2 + RO2 and the correlation between predictions and observations. Including bromine chemistry in the model constrained by observations of BrO improved the correlation between observed and predicted HO2 + RO2 and OH, and brought the average hourly OH and HO2 + RO2 predictions closer to the observations. These model comparisons confirmed our understanding of the dominant HOx sources and sinks in this environment and indicated that BrO impacted the OH levels at Summit. Although, significant discrepancies between observed and predicted OH could not be explained by the measured BrO. Finally, observations of enhanced RGM were found to be coincident with under prediction of OH.",,,,"Lefer, Barry/X-9091-2019; brough, neil/AAG-8550-2019; Stutz, Jochen/K-7159-2014; Liao, Jin/H-4865-2013","Lefer, Barry/0000-0001-9520-5495; brough, neil/0000-0002-2316-5292; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,,,,,,2011.0,11.0,16,,,,,8577,8591,,10.5194/acp-11-8577-2011,,,,,,,WOS:000294406300022,,,,,,Houston
920,J,"Choi, Y",,,,"Choi, Y.",,,The impact of satellite-adjusted NOx emissions on simulated NOx and O-3 discrepancies in the urban and outflow areas of the Pacific and Lower Middle US,ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"We analyze the simulation results from a CMAQ model and GOME-2 NO2 retrievals over the United States for August 2009 to estimate the model-simulated biases of NOx concentrations over six geological regions (Pacific Coast = PC, Rocky Mountains = RM, Lower Middle = LM, Upper Middle = UM, Southeast = SE, Northeast = NE). By comparing GOME-2 NO2 columns to corresponding CMAQ NO2 columns, we produced satellite-adjusted NOx emission (""GOME2009"") and compared baseline emission (""BASE2009"") CMAQ simulations with GOME2009 CMAQ runs. We found that the latter exhibited decreases of -5.6%, -12.3%, -21.3%, and -15.9% over the PC, RM, LM, and SE regions, respectively, and increases of +2.3% and +10.0% over the UM and NE regions. In addition, we found that changes in NOx emissions generally mitigate discrepancies between the surface NOx concentrations of baseline CMAQ and those of AQS at EPA AQS stations (mean bias of +19.8% to -13.7% over PC, -13.8% to -36.7% over RM, +149.7% to -1.8% over LM, +22.5% to -7.8% over UM, +31.3% to -7.9% over SE, and +11.6% to +0.7% over NE). The relatively high simulated NOx biases from baseline CMAQ over LM (+149.7%) are likely the results of over-predictions of simulated NOx emissions, which could shed light on those from global/regional Chemical Transport Models. We also perform more detailed investigations on surface NOx and O-3 concentrations in two urban and outflow areas, PC (e.g., Los Angeles, South Pasadena, Anaheim, La Habra and Riverside) and LM (e.g., Houston, Beaumont and Sulphur). From two case studies, we found that the GOME2009 emissions decreased surface NOx concentrations significantly in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and in those of LM (up to 10 ppbv) during the daytime and that simulated NOx concentrations from CMAQ with GOME2009 compare well to those of in-situ AQS observations. A significant reduction in NOx concentrations resulted in a comparable increase in surface O-3 concentrations in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and the resulting simulated O-3 concentrations compare well with in-situ surface O-3 observations over South Pasadena, Anaheim, and Riverside. Over Houston, Beaumont, and Sulphur, large reductions in NOx emissions from CMAQ with GOME2009 coincides with large reduced concentrations of simulated NOx. These concentrations are similar to those of the EPA AQS NOx observations. However, the resulting simulated increase in surface O-3 at the urban stations in Houston and Sulphur exacerbated preexisting high O-3 over-predictions of the baseline CMAQ. This study implies that simulated low O-3 biases in the urban areas of PC are likely caused by simulated high NOx biases, but high O-3 biases in the urban areas of LM cannot be explained by simulated high NOx biases over the region. This study also suggests that both in-situ surface NOx and O-3 observations should be used simultaneously to resolve issues pertaining to simulated high/low O-3 bias and that remote-sensing data could be used as a constraint for bottom-up emissions. In addition, we also found that daytime O-3 reductions over the outflow regions of LM following large reductions in NOx emissions in the urban areas are significantly larger than they are over outflow regions of PC. These findings provide policymakers in the two regions with information critical to establishing strategies for mitigating air pollution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,2014.0,14.0,2,,,,,675,690,,10.5194/acp-14-675-2014,,,,,,,WOS:000330853800011,,,,,,Houston

These igneous centers are interpreted to have deflected propagating faults, as they are rheologically strong relative to the surrounding rocks. We conducted detailed field mapping and analysis of fracture and fault data along the eastern segment of the Chalk Draw Fault in Big Bend National Park to evaluate its kinematic evolution and interaction with Paleogene plutons. Our primary results document the following key relationships: (1) the Rosillos Laccolith and other Paleogene plutons in the study area are pervasively fractured, dominantly by northwest-striking mode I fractures, which generally do not extend into adjacent sedimentary rock sequences; (2) throw on the eastern Chalk Draw Fault is strongly asymmetric, decreasing rapidly as it enters the Rosillos Laccolith; and (3) analysis of fault-slip data in the region documents dominantly N 52 degrees E-directed regional extension along the northwest-striking segment of the Chalk Draw Fault and secondary structures. We interpret these relationships to indicate that the Rosillos Laccolith developed pervasive mode I fractures with a dominant northwest-southeast orientation during cooling under Basin and Range extensional stresses but that this occurred prior to extensional faulting within the region. We suggest that the highly fractured nature of the Rosillos Laccolith resulted in it being rheologically weaker than the surrounding Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, which resulted in (1) hindering southward propagation of the Chalk Draw Fault by dissipating stress at the fault tip within the highly fractured laccolith and (2) the strongly asymmetric distribution of slip due to a strong rheological contrast during fault propagation.",,,,"Robinson, Alexander C/C-8532-2012","Robinson, Alexander C/0000-0001-9196-7054",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1376,1537-5269,,,,SEP,2015.0,123.0,5,,,,,385,403,,10.1086/682935,,,,,,,WOS:000363691400001,,,,,,Houston

The Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone is an outcrop analog for fluvial-tidal systems with primary reservoirs being deposited as tidally influenced valley filling point bars. The study outcrops expose three valley systems in Neilson Wash of Utah. Light detection and ranging-derived digital outcrop models have been used to characterize shale length, width, thickness, and frequency of each valley fill succession. Long, uncommon, and anisotropic shales in valley 1 (V1) were deposited in a braided setting with little tidal influence. In contrast, shales in valley 2 (V2) were abundant, short, common, and equidimensional, suggesting deposition by more tidally influenced meandering rivers. Short, frequent, and equidimensional shales in valley 3 (V3) were deposited in single-thread meandering rivers with less tidal influence. A sandstone-shale model was used to estimate the effects of shales on vertical to horizontal permeability ratio (k(v)/k(h)). The unique character of each depositional unit was reflected in resultant k(v)/k(h) distributions. The valley fill deposits, V1, V2, and V3, had average k(v)/k(h) ratios of 0.11, 0.09, and 0.17, respectively. More tidally influenced reservoirs such as the studied V2 had short but frequent shales, which resulted in low k(v)/k(h) estimates. Estimates of k(v)/k(h) for valleys that predominantly contained fluvial point bar deposits with lesser tidal influence (V1 and V3) were higher. The results of this study highlight the link between shale heterogeneity, reservoir architecture, and inferred flow parameters.","[Biber, Kivanc; Khan, Shuhab D.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, 312 Sci & Res Bldg 1, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Bhattacharya, Janok P.] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Barton, Mark D.] Shell Explorat & Prod, 200 N Dairy Ashford Rd, Houston, TX 77079 USA; [Glennie, Craig L.] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Gulf Freeway,Bldg 4,Room 216, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Biber, K (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, 312 Sci & Res Bldg 1, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",kivancbiber@gmail.com; sdkhan@central.uh.edu; bhattaj@mcmaster.ca; mark.barton@shell.com; clglennie@uh.edu,"Khan, Shuhab D/C-6839-2008","Khan, Shuhab D/0000-0002-3848-8190",Shell Oil Company; Quantitative Sedimentology Laboratories Consortium of the University of Houston,"Light detection and ranging data for this project were acquired by funding from Shell Oil Company.

Decreasing trends in background Hg-0 were identified in the 7.5- and 5.5-yr records at TF and PM with decline rates of 3.3 parts per quadrillion by volume (ppqv) yr(-1) and 6.3 ppqv yr(-1), respectively. Common characteristics at these sites were the reproducible annual cycle of Hg-0 with its maximum in winter-spring and minimum in fall, comprised of a positive trend in the warm season (spring - early fall) and a negative one in the cool season (late fall - winter). Year-to-year variability was observed in the warm season decline in Hg-0 at TF varying from a minimum total (complete) seasonal loss of 43 ppqv in 2009 to a maximum of 92 ppqv in 2005, whereas variability remained small at AI and PM. The coastal site TF differed from the other two sites with its exceptionally low levels (as low as below 50 ppqv) in the nocturnal inversion layer possibly due to dissolution in dew water. Measurements of Hg-0 at PM exhibited the smallest diurnal to annual variability among the three environments, where peak levels rarely exceeded 250 ppqv and the minimum was typically 100 ppqv. It should be noted that summertime diurnal patterns at TF and AI were opposite in phase indicating strong sink(s) for Hg-0 during the day in the marine boundary layer, which was consistent with the hypothesis of Hg-0 oxidation by halogen radicals there. Mixing ratios of RGM in the coastal and marine boundary layers reached annual maxima in spring and minima in fall, whereas at PM levels were generally below the limit of detection (LOD) except in spring. RGM levels at AI were higher than at TF and PM indicating a stronger source strength in the marine environment. Mixing ratios of Hg-P at AI and TF were close in magnitude to RGM levels and were mostly below 1 ppqv. Diurnal variation in Hg-P was barely discernible at TF and AI in spring and summer. Higher levels of Hg-P were observed during the day, while values that were smaller, but above the LOD, occurred at night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,2012.0,12.0,11,,,,,5099,5112,,10.5194/acp-12-5099-2012,,,,,,,WOS:000305281600019,,,,,,Houston

This study demonstrates a technique which uses a stand-alone GPS station to conduct millimeter-accuracy landslide monitoring. The Precise Point Positioning with Single Receiver Phase Ambiguity (PPP-SRPA) resolution employed by the GIPSY/OASIS software package (V6.1.2) was applied in this study. Two-years of continuous GPS data collected at a creeping landslide were used to evaluate the accuracy of the PPP-SRPA solutions. The criterion for accuracy was the root-mean-square (RMS) of residuals of the PPP-SRPA solutions with respect to ""true"" landslide displacements over the two-year period. RMS is often regarded as repeatability or precision in GPS literature. However, when contrasted with a known ""true"" position or displacement it could be termed RMS accuracy or simply accuracy. This study indicated that the PPP-SRPA resolution can provide an accuracy of 2 to 3 mm horizontally and 8 mm vertically for 24-hour sessions with few outliers (< 1%) in the Puerto Rico region. Horizontal accuracy below 5 mm can be stably achieved with 4-hour or longer sessions if avoiding the collection of data during extreme weather conditions. Vertical accuracy below 10 mm can be achieved with 8-hour or longer sessions. This study indicates that the PPP-SRPA resolution is competitive with the conventional carrier-phase double-difference network resolution for static (longer than 4 hours) landslide monitoring while maintaining many advantages. It is evident that the PPP-SRPA method would become an attractive alternative to the conventional carrier-phase double-difference method for landslide monitoring, notably in remote areas or developing countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2081-9919,2081-9943,,,,MAR,2013.0,3.0,1,,,,,22,31,,10.2478/jogs-2013-0001,,,,,,,WOS:000435688700004,,,,,,Houston

The present study proposes a two-scale model based on microscale (small-scale) measurements to predict the geomechanical properties of a carbonate formation at the core scale. At the small scale, we develop a physically representative element by accounting for the effective stiffness of a constitutive mineral and of voids. At the large scale, we account for the volume fraction of each mineral, the porosity, and the pore structure of the void space. The elastic deformation of a large-scale model is simulated using a finite element method (FEM), whose results are tested against independent lab measurements. The proposed two-scale model has applications for geomechanical characterization of a formation at the core scale from drill cuttings.","[Li, Wenfeng; Sakhaee-Pour, A.] Univ Houston, Dept Petr Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Sakhaee-Pour, A (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Petr Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",asakhaee@central.uh.edu,,,,,"Ameen MS, 2009, MAR PETROL GEOL, V26, P430, DOI 10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2009.01.017; [Anonymous], 2017, ANN EN OUTL 2017 PRO; Bakhorji A.

The unique physical properties of halite (ductility, low density, flowability, and impermeability) can be critical factors in hydrocarbon traps and underground storage. However, seismic imaging and interpretation can be challenging when salt structures are present due to their complex geometry and large impedance contrasts relative to surrounding rocks. To investigate the properties of rock salt in terms of elastic parameters, we use ultrasonic laboratory measurements and well logs. In the laboratory, we have analyzed the effects of composition, crystalline structure, pressure, and temperature on the elastic behavior of a variety of rock salt samples. The samples include pure halite (>95 wt%) from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) area, argillaceous rock salt from the Zipaquira Mine, Colombia, and crystalline salt from the Goderich Mine, Canada. Current measurements suggest that the GOM salt cores behave isotropically in general. The Zipaquira salt samples show velocity and density variations on account of their heterogeneous composition. The Goderich halite crystals display distinct cubic anisotropy. Measurements on the GOM samples at varying confining pressures and temperatures indicate that increasing pressure elevates velocity whereas increasing temperature decreases velocity. From the analysis of 145 log suites from boreholes drilled through rock salt in the northern GOM, we found that, within the salt formations, P-wave velocities increased slightly with depth (approximately 5 m/s per km). The S-wave velocities from three wells range from 2280 to 2580 m/s. Bulk densities from all the wells cluster at 2160 +/- 30 kg/m(3). These laboratory and log measurements provide new values for the elastic properties of rock salt, which can assist in velocity model building, synthetic seismogram generation, and the understanding of the rock physics of halite.","[Zong, Jingjing; Stewart, Robert R.; Dyaur, Nikolay] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Allied Geophys Labs, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Myers, Michael T.] Univ Houston, Dept Petr Engn, Cullen Coll Engn, Houston, TX USA","Zong, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Allied Geophys Labs, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",jzong@uh.edu; rrstewart@uh.edu; nidyaur@gmail.com; mtmyers@uh.edu,,,Allied Geophysical Laboratories at the University of Houston,"This work is supported by the Allied Geophysical Laboratories at the University of Houston.

Logging-while-drilling (LWD) data obtained during JIP Leg II and conventional 3-D seismic data allowed for the identification of thick highly concentrated hydrate layers by integrating rock physics modeling, amplitude and thin layer analysis, and spectral decomposition. Rock physics modeling with constraints from three JIP LWD holes allowed for the analysis of variations in acoustic amplitude characteristics as a product of hydrate saturation, gas saturation, and reservoir thickness. Using the well log-derived acoustic models, thick highly concentrated gas hydrate with and without underlying free gas accumulations have been identified. These results suggest that thick highly concentrated gas-hydrate-bearing sand units (with thicknesses greater than half of the seismic tuning thickness and gas hydrate saturations greater than 50%) underlain by gas can be differentiated from sands containing only gas, but thin gas-hydrate-bearing sand units with low gas hydrate concentrations (with thicknesses less than half of the seismic tuning thickness and gas hydrate saturations less than 50%) are difficult to identify from post-stack seismic amplitude data alone. Within GC955, we have identified six zones with seismic amplitude anomalies interpreted as being caused by gas hydrate deposits with variable lateral extent, thickness and saturation, and in some cases overlying free-gas-bearing intervals. Synthetic seismic images produced from well-log- and model-derived velocity and density distributions mimic similar reflection characteristics in the corresponding field seismic data.

The model for the proppant transport is based on the recently obtained slurry flow solution inside a channel, where the latter utilizes a phenomenological constitutive relationship for a slurry. This approach allows us to describe the transition from Poiseuille flow with an effective viscosity to Darcy flow as the particle concentration increases towards the maximum value. The algorithm is presented for the one-dimensional case, for which propagation of a symmetric Kristinovich-Zheltov-Geertsma-De Klerk fracture is considered. To examine the effectiveness of the Lagrangian approach for proppant transport modelling, a set of parameters, for which proppant particles reach the fracture tip and cause the development of a proppant plug is selected. In this situation, the coupling between the hydraulic fracture propagation and proppant transport is the most significant. To estimate the accuracy of the Lagrangian proppant transport model, the results are compared to the predictions of an Eulerian proppant transport model, which utilizes the same algorithm for hydraulic fracture propagation. It is shown that, although both approaches have the same convergence rate, the error of the Lagrangian approach is three to five times smaller, which depends on the number of proppant elements used in the Lagrangian approach. This permits us to use a coarser mesh for hydraulic fracture propagation, and to obtain results with similar accuracy up to a hundred times faster.",,,,,"Peirce, Anthony/0000-0002-8437-7889",,,,,,,,,,,,0723-2632,1434-453X,,,,NOV,2015.0,48.0,6,,,,,2541,2550,,10.1007/s00603-015-0835-6,,,,,,,WOS:000365291600025,,,,,,Houston

Since it is not possible to measure the radiation environment inside of human organs in deep space, simulations based on radiation transport/interaction codes coupled to phantoms of tissue equivalent materials are used. However, the calculated results depend on the models used in the codes, and it is therefore necessary to verify their validity by comparison with measured data. The goal of this paper is to compare absorbed doses obtained in the MATROSHKA-R experiment performed at the International Space Station (ISS) with simulations performed with the three-dimensional Monte Carlo Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The absorbed dose was measured using passive detectors (packages of thermoluminescent and plastic nuclear track detectors) placed on the surface of the spherical tissue equivalent phantom MATROSHKA-R, which was exposed aboard the ISS in the Service Zvezda Module from December 2005 to September 2006. The data calculated by PHITS assuming an ISS shielding of 3 g/cm(2) and 5 g/cm(2) aluminum mass thickness were in good agreement with the measurements. Using a simplified geometrical model of the ISS, the influence of variations in altitude and wall mass thickness of the ISS on the calculated absorbed dose was estimated. The uncertainties of the calculated data are also discussed; the relative expanded uncertainty of absorbed dose in phantom was estimated to be 44% at a 95% confidence level. (C) 2011 COSPAR.

It is difficult to recover large samples from shale formations because they are mechanically unstable and usually break down into pieces. The present study develops a two-scale model that uses drill cuttings to estimate the static elastic properties of shales at the core scale. We first propose a physically representative element to capture the elastic deformation of a solid grain with a known minerology by accounting for the grain size and its elastic properties using the structural-mechanics approach (a small-scale model). We then develop a core-scale model dependent on the volume fractions of the minerals, which are obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD), for different realizations of the spatial distribution of the solid grains (large-scale model). The sensitivity of the large-scale model to the number of the elements is tested. The proposed model shows promising results for four shale formations (New Albany, Rocky Mountain Siliceous, Lower Bakken, and Barnett) and has major applications for the geomechanical characterization of a formation from drill cuttings.","[Sakhaee-Pour, A.] Univ Houston, Petr Engn Dept, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Li, Wenfeng] Univ Houston, Petr Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA","Sakhaee-Pour, A (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Petr Engn Dept, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",,,,,,"Abedi S, 2016, ACTA GEOTECH, V11, P775, DOI 10.1007/s11440-016-0476-2; Abedi S, 2016, ACTA GEOTECH, V11, P559, DOI 10.1007/s11440-015-0426-4; Akrad O., 2011, SPE ANN TECHN C EXH, DOI [10.2118/146658-MS, DOI 10.2118/146658-MS]; Anders MH, 2014, J STRUCT GEOL, V69, P377, DOI 10.1016/j.jsg.2014.05.011; Arbogast T, 2000, SIAM J NUMER ANAL, V37, P1295, DOI 10.1137/S0036142996308447; Bennett KC, 2015, ACTA GEOTECH, V10, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11440-014-0363-7; Bobko C, 2008, MECH MATER, V40, P318, DOI 10.1016/j.mechmat.2007.09.006; BRYANT S, 1992, PHYS REV A, V46, P2004, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevA.46.2004; Chen Q, 2016, INT J ROCK MECH MIN, V84, P95, DOI 10.1016/j.ijrmms.2016.02.007; CHENG AHD, 1993, INT J ROCK MECH MIN, V30, P1119, DOI 10.1016/0148-9062(93)90081-N; Daigle H, 2017, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V44, P2167, DOI 10.1002/2016GL072165; Gale JFW, 2014, AAPG BULL, V98, P2165, DOI 10.1306/08121413151; Goovaerts P., 1997, GEOSTATISTICS NATURA; Gutierrez M, 2001, SPE RESERV EVAL ENG, V4, P164, DOI 10.2118/72095-PA; Herrmann HJ, 1998, CONTINUUM MECH THERM, V10, P189, DOI 10.1007/s001610050089; HORNBY BE, 1994, GEOPHYSICS, V59, P1570, DOI 10.1190/1.1443546; Jin H., 2013, UNC RES TECHN C DENV, DOI [10.15530/URTEC-1581243-MS, DOI 10.15530/URTEC-1581243-MS]; LAUBACH S, 2000, LEADING EDGE, V19, P704, DOI DOI 10.1190/1.1438694; Levin V, 2012, INT J ENG SCI, V61, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.ijengsci.2012.06.011; Levin VM, 2005, INT J SOLIDS STRUCT, V42, P393, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2004.06.044; Li CY, 2003, INT J SOLIDS STRUCT, V40, P2487, DOI 10.1016/S0020-7683(03)00056-8; Li WF, 2016, PETROPHYSICS, V57, P597; Loucks RG, 2009, J SEDIMENT RES, V79, P848, DOI 10.2110/jsr.2009.092; Mavko G., 2009, ROCK PHYS HDB TOOLS, P512; Milliken KL, 2013, AAPG BULL, V97, P177, DOI 10.1306/07231212048; Milliken KL, 2012, AAPG BULL, V96, P1553, DOI 10.1306/12011111129; Monfared S, 2016, J MECH PHYS SOLIDS, V88, P186, DOI 10.1016/j.jmps.2015.12.006; Ortega JA, 2007, ACTA GEOTECH, V2, P155, DOI 10.1007/s11440-007-0038-8; Ortega OJ, 2006, AAPG BULL, V90, P193, DOI 10.1306/08250505059; Pommer L., 2013, P UNC RES TECHN C DE, P1639, DOI DOI 10.1190/URTEC2013-167; Rybacki E, 2015, J PETROL SCI ENG, V135, P702, DOI 10.1016/j.petrol.2015.10.028; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2008, NANOTECHNOLOGY, V19, DOI 10.1088/0957-4484/19/8/085702; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2016, J NAT GAS SCI ENG, V30, P578, DOI 10.1016/j.jngse.2016.02.044; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2015, FUEL, V143, P467, DOI 10.1016/j.fuel.2014.11.053; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2014, AAPG BULL, V98, P663, DOI 10.1306/08011312078; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2012, SPE RESERV EVAL ENG, V15, P401, DOI 10.2118/146944-PA; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2009, COMP MATER SCI, V45, P266, DOI 10.1016/j.commatsci.2008.09.024; Sakhaee-Pour A, 2009, SOLID STATE COMMUN, V149, P91, DOI 10.1016/j.ssc.2008.09.050; Saxena N, 2016, COMPUT GEOSCI-UK, V88, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.cageo.2015.12.008; Saxena N, 2015, GEOPHYSICS, V80, pL11, DOI 10.1190/GEO2014-0309.1; Sayers CM, 2016, GEOPHYSICS, V81, pC193, DOI 10.1190/GEO2016-0005.1; Sayers CM, 2013, GEOPHYSICS, V78, pD65, DOI 10.1190/GEO2012-0309.1; Sheibani F., 2013, P ISRM INT C EFF SUS, P741; Simpson G., 2015, SWLA 56 ANN LOGG S L; Sone H., 2012, THESIS; Sone H, 2013, GEOPHYSICS, V78, pD378, DOI 10.1190/GEO2013-0050.1; Ulm FJ, 2006, ACTA GEOTECH, V1, P77, DOI 10.1007/s11440-006-0009-5; Vermylen P.

In this study, a suite of 23 shergottites, spanning their known range in bulk compositions, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Lu-Hf isotopes, were measured for Re-187-Os-187 isotopic systematics and highly siderophile element abundances (HSE: including Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, Re). The chief objective was to gain new insight on the chemical evolution of the martian mantle by unraveling the long-term HSE budget of its derivative melts. Possible effects upon HSEs related to crustal contamination, as well as terrestrial and/or martian surface alteration are also examined. Some of the shergottites are hot arid-desert finds. Their respective acetic acid leachates and residues show that both Re and Os display open-system behavior during sample residence at or near the martian and/or terrestrial surfaces. In some meteorites, the alteration effects can be circumvented by analysis of the leached residues. For those shergottites believed to record robust Re-Os isotopic systematics, calculated initial Os-187/Os-188 are well correlated with the initial Nd-143/Nd-144. Shergottites from mantle sources with long-term melt-depleted characteristics (initial epsilon Nd-143 of + 36 to + 40) have chondritic initial gamma Os-187 ranging from -0.5 to + 2.5. Shergottites with intermediate initial epsilon Nd-143 of + 8 to + 17 have a range in initial gamma Os-187 of -0.6 to + 2.3, which overlaps the range for depleted shergottites. Shergottites from long-term enriched sources, with initial epsilon Nd-143 of similar to-7, are characterized by suprachondritic gamma Os-187 values of + 5 to + 15. The initial gamma Os-187 variations for the shergottites do not show a correlation with indices of magmatic differentiation, such as MgO, or any systematic differences between hot arid-desert finds, Antarctic finds, or observed falls. The strong correlation between the initial epsilon Nd-143 and gamma Os-187 in shergottites from approximately + 40 and 0 to -7 and + 15, respectively, is assessed in models for mixing depleted mantle-derived melts with ancient crust (modeled to be similar to evolved shergottite in composition), and with assimilation-fractional crystallization. These models show that the correlation is unlikely to result from participation of martian crust. More likely, this correlation relates to contributions from depleted and enriched reservoirs formed in a martian magma ocean at ca. 4.5 Ga. These models indicate that the shergottite endmember sources were generated by mixing between residual melts and cumulates that formed at variable stages during solidification of a magma ocean. The expanded database for the HSE abundances in shergottites suggests that their martian mantle sources have similar HSE abundances to the terrestrial mantle, consistent with prior studies. The relatively high HSE abundances in both planetary mantles likely cannot be accounted for by high pressure-temperature metal-silicate partitioning at the bases of magma oceans, as has been suggested for Earth. If the HSE were instead supplied by late accretion, this event must have occurred prior to the crystallization of the last martian magma ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to test different pilot point distributions to find reasonable estimates of aquifer properties for the alluvial aquifer, to simulate flux from rivers, and to demonstrate how changes in pumping rates for different scenarios affect areas of long-term water-level declines over time. The model was calibrated using the parameter estimation code. Additional calibration was achieved using pilot points with regularization and singular value decomposition. Pilot point parameter values were estimated at a number of discrete locations in the study area to obtain reasonable estimates of aquifer properties. Nine pumping scenarios for the years 2011 to 2020 were tested and compared to the simulated water-level heads from 2010. Hydraulic conductivity values from pilot point calibration ranged between 42 and 173 m/d. Specific yield values ranged between 0.19 and 0.337. Recharge rates ranged between 0.00009 and 0.0006 m/d. The model was calibrated using 2,322 hydraulic head measurements for the years 2000 to 2010 from 150 observation wells located in the study area. For all scenarios, the volume of water depleted ranged between 5.7 and 23.3 percent, except in Scenario 2 (minimum pumping rates), in which the volume increased by 2.5 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1078-7275,1558-9161,,,,FEB,2015.0,21.0,1,,,,,1,19,,,,,,,,,WOS:000352094900001,,,,,,Houston

In the cloud-slicing approach, the slope of the above-cloud NO2 column versus the cloud scene pressure is proportional to the NO2 VMR. In this work, we use a sample of nearby OMI pixel data from a single orbit for the linear fit. The OMI data include cloud scene pressures from the rotational-Raman algorithm and above-cloud NO2 vertical column density (VCD) (defined as the NO2 column from the cloud scene pressure to the top of the atmosphere) from a differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) algorithm. We compare OMI-derived NO2 VMRs with in situ aircraft profiles measured during the NASA Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment Phase B (INTEX-B) campaign in 2006. The agreement is generally within the estimated uncertainties when appropriate data screening is applied. We then derive a global seasonal climatology of free-tropospheric NO2 VMR in cloudy conditions. Enhanced NO2 in the free troposphere commonly appears near polluted urban locations where NO2 produced in the boundary layer may be transported vertically out of the boundary layer and then horizontally away from the source. Signatures of lightning NO2 are also shown throughout low and middle latitude regions in summer months. A profile analysis of our cloudslicing data indicates signatures of lightning-generated NO2 in the upper troposphere. Comparison of the climatology with simulations from the global modeling initiative (GMI) for cloudy conditions (cloud optical depth > 10) shows similarities in the spatial patterns of continental pollution outflow. However, there are also some differences in the seasonal variation of free-tropospheric NO2 VMRs near highly populated regions and in areas affected by lightning-generated NOx.",,,,"Duncan, Bryan/A-5962-2011; Joiner, Joanna/D-6264-2012; Krotkov, Nickolay A/E-1541-2012","Joiner, Joanna/0000-0003-4278-1020; Krotkov, Nickolay A/0000-0001-6170-6750; Choi, Sungyeon/0000-0003-1608-343X",,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,2014.0,14.0,19,,,,,10565,10588,,10.5194/acp-14-10565-2014,,,,,,,WOS:000344164800011,,,,,,Houston

Analysis of extreme values over a given time period is usually done by fitting a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to the maximum values in the data; however, lack of sufficient weather recordings due to missing data or violation of independence assumptions (block maxima should be over a large time interval) may result in a poor fit for the GEV model. Modelling over larger, clustered regions may overcome some of these problems and can provide insight into macroscopic weather and climate changes. In this article, we analyse temperature measurements in July and August taken from stations across Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana. We introduce clustering techniques which group stations by temperature trends and mutual information before performing extreme value analysis on the clusters of time series. This obviates some of the problems commonly encountered in analysing single station weather data. Extreme analysis of the resulting clusters provides compelling evidence of nonstationarity of the distributional parameters in the GEV model and points to an increased likelihood from the period roughly 1980 to present of observing higher extreme temperatures for the months of July and August. We tabulate the probabilities of extreme temperatures in the clusters according to a nonstationary model. Our techniques can be easily adapted to a wide range of climatological problems.","[Carney, Meagan; Azencott, Robert; Nicol, Matthew] Univ Houston, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Nicol, M (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",nicol@math.uh.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1600780],"M.

Several HONO sources were accounted for in simulations, such as gas phase formation, direct emissions, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) hydrolysis, photoinduced formation from excited NO2 and photo-induced conversion of NO2 into HONO on surfaces covered with organic materials. Compared to the gas-phase HONO formation there was about a tenfold increase in HONO mixing ratios when additional HONO sources were taken into account, which improved the correlation between modeled and measured values. Concentrations of HONO simulated with only gas phase chemistry did not change with altitude, while measured HONO concentrations decrease with height. A trend of decreasing HONO concentration with altitude was well captured with CMAQ predicted concentrations when heterogeneous chemistry and photolytic sources of HONO were taken into account. Heterogeneous HONO production mainly accelerated morning ozone formation, albeit slightly. Also HONO formation from excited NO2 only slightly affected HONO and ozone (O-3) concentrations. Photo-induced conversion of NO2 into HONO on surfaces covered with organic materials turned out to be a strong source of daytime HONO. Since HONO immediately photo-dissociates during daytime its ambient mixing ratios were only marginally altered (up to 0.5 ppbv), but significant increase in the hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone concentration was obtained. In contrast to heterogeneous HONO formation that mainly accelerated morning ozone formation, inclusion of photo-induced surface chemistry influenced ozone throughout the day.",,,,"Ngan, Fong/AAC-6242-2019; Ngan, Fong/G-1324-2012","Ngan, Fong/0000-0002-7263-7727; Ngan, Fong/0000-0002-7263-7727",,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,2012.0,12.0,15,,,,,6939,6951,,10.5194/acp-12-6939-2012,,,,,,,WOS:000308287000013,,,,,,Houston

The model is based on the Godunov type finite volume scheme on unstructured triangular meshes. A mass balance preserving wet/dry boundary solution algorithm is integrated in the numerical scheme to satisfy the positive-depth condition and minimize the numerical instability when treating the propagation of wave front in regions of dry bed. The balance between bed slope and flux terms is also preserved for still water conditions on irregular topography. The 2-D solver is verified by simulating selected dam break cases, where good agreement with measured data is achieved.

Quantitative models to constrain the fractionation due to core formation have not been possible due to the lack of activity and partitioning data. Interaction parameters in Fe-Si liquids have been measured at 1 GPa, 1600 degrees C and increase in the order Cd (6), Ag (10), Sn (28), Bi (46), and P (58). These large and positive values contrast with smaller and negative values in Fe-S liquids indicating that any chalcophile behavior exhibited by these elements will be erased by dissolution of a small amount of Si in the metallic liquid. A newly updated activity model is applied to Earth, Mars, and Vesta. Five elements (P, Zn, Sn, Cd, and In) in Earth's primitive upper mantle can largely be explained by metal-silicate equilibrium at high PT conditions where the core-forming metal is a Fe-Ni-S-Si-C metallic liquid, but two other-Ag and Bi-become overabundant during core formation and require a removal mechanism such as late sulfide segregation. All of the VSE in the mantle of Mars are consistent with core formation in a volatile element depleted body, and do not require any additional processes. Only P and Ag in Vesta's mantle are consistent with combined core formation and volatile-depleted precursors, whereas the rest require accretion of chondritic or volatile-bearing material after core formation. The concentrations of Zn, Ag, and Cd modeled for Vesta's core are similar to the concentration range measured in magmatic iron meteorites indicating that these volatile elements were already depleted in Vesta's precursor materials.","[Righter, K.] NASA JSC, Mailcode X12,2101 NASA Pkwy, Houston, TX 77058 USA; [Pando, K.] NASA JSC, UTC Jacobs JETS Contract, Houston, TX 77058 USA; [Ross, D.

During the 13 month period, the measured O-3 concentration fluctuated around a mean of 41 ppb and showed a broad springtime maximum and summertime minimum that can be attributed to regional circulation over subtropical Asia. Beryllium-7, CO, RH, and the normalized fraction of Be-7, f(Be-7, Pb-210) were used to identify SI days based on several criteria. Of the total analyzed days, 14 SI days (approximately 4.6%) were found, indicating that SI phenomenon in the subtropical region is much less frequent than at northern midlatitudes. About two thirds of the SI days occurred in the winter, whereas none were found in the summer. The seasonality of SI occurrence could be related to the position of the subtropical jet stream. The proportion of surface O-3 derived from the stratosphere was estimated to be only 1.3% on a yearly basis, increasing to similar to 3.2% in the winter and 27% during the SI days, demonstrating the importance of downward transport of stratospheric air in affecting the level of surface ozone.",,,,"Lin, CY/K-6503-2014; Liang, Mao-Chang/P-9796-2018","Liang, Mao-Chang/0000-0002-5294-9344; LIN, PO-HSIUNG/0000-0002-6410-6221",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,27-Mar,2014.0,119.0,6,,,,,3527,3536,,10.1002/2013JD020736,,,,,,,WOS:000336046600049,,,,,,Houston

The values of the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy of the crystal solution equilibrium suggest that octanol may structure around the hematin solute molecules and along the crystal interface. Time-resolved in situ atomic force microscopy demonstrates that hematin crystal growth strictly follows classical layer growth mechanisms. Steps propagate by the attachment of solute molecules, described by a first-order chemical rate law. The molecules reach the steps via adsorption on the crystal surface, followed by surface diffusion, and the kinetic barriers of this pathway offer additional crystallization control strategies. Solute incorporation into steps from the adjacent lower and upper terraces is strongly asymmetric, with the lower terrace contributing the major solute amount. These findings provide a foundation for the rational design of hematin crystals that may find applications utilizing their high magnetic and optical anisotropy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1528-7483,1528-7505,,,,NOV,2015.0,15.0,11,,,,,5535,5542,,10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01157,,,,,,,WOS:000364356000044,,,,,,Houston

The results showed that SOC contents of 0-60cm soil layer in transects ranged from 0.46 to 10.15gkg(-1) and average values of soil profiles ranged from 2.15 to 5.00gkg(-1). The SOC contents tended to increase from the river flood land to the salt beach, which could be accounted for the organic matters including large algae, the bodies and excretion of marine animals due to the feedback of tides. The significant difference of SOC contents at different vegetation communities was observed, while the difference of SOC in soil profiles was not obvious. The SOC contents in 0-30cm soil layers decreased with plant growth period, while in 40-60cm soil layers were relatively stable. The mean soil organic carbon density was 3.05kgCm(-2) in study region, which was much lower than that reported in other ecosystems, and its spatiotemporal variations were consistent with that of SOC content. Further analysis revealed that SOC was positively correlated with total nitrogen and clay contents.

The granitoids from the Ageledaban complex have a variable SiO2 content, from 62.83 to 73.35 wt.% and A/CNK< 1.1 (except for YM61-2). They have rare earth element and trace element patterns that are enriched in light rare earth elements, Rb, Pb, Th, and U, and are depleted in Ba, P, Sr, Ti, and Nb, indicative of weakly peraluminous-metaluminous I-type affinity. Zircon U-Pb dating reveals that the Ageledaban complex was emplaced at ca. 80 Ma. Zircons from the monzogranite and monzonite samples with concordant Pb-206/U-238 ages about 80 Ma have a zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) of -6.6 to -1.1, corresponding to the Mesoproterozoic Hf crustal model ages (T-DM (C) = 1.2-1.6 Ga); the remaining inherited zircons from the monzonite with concordant Pb-206/U-238 ages of about 108.1 Ma have epsilon(Hf)(t) values that range from -8.3 to -5.0, corresponding to the Mesoproterozoic Hf crustal model ages with an average of 1.6 Ga. These signatures indicate that the Ageledaban granitoids may have been derived from the partial melting of a mixed mantle-crust source. Together with the age and geochemical data in the literature, we propose that the collisional event in the KKT in northwestern Tibet would postdate the northern Lhasa-southern Qiangtang collision, which occurred first in the Amdo in the east and later in the Shiquanhe in central Tibet. Our results support the previous view that the collision of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone (BNSZ) may be diachronous.","[Liu, Lijie; Hou, Mingcai] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lijie; Hou, Mingcai] Chengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lijie] East China Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yue] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tang, Hongwei] Sichuan Bur Geol Nucl Ind, Deyang, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Christopher] Univ Houston, Coll Earth & Atmospher Sci, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX USA","Hou, MC (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu, Peoples R China.; Hou, MC (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",houmc@cdut.edu.cn,,,"regional geologic survey of China [1212011120538, 1212011220629];  [J43E021020];  [J43E022019];  [J43E022020];  [J43E023019];  [J43E023020]","This study was supported by the Xinjiang 1: 50,000 maps of J43E021020, J43E022019, J43E022020, J43E023019, and J43E023020, regarding the regional geologic survey of China (1212011120538; 1212011220629).","ALLEGRE CJ, 1984, NATURE, V307, P17, DOI 10.1038/307017a0; Andersen T, 2002, CHEM GEOL, V192, P59, DOI 10.1016/S0009-2541(02)00195-X; Annen C, 2002, EARTH PLANET SC LETT, V203, P937, DOI 10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00929-9; Annen C, 2006, J PETROL, V47, P505, DOI 10.1093/petrology/egi084; [???

Density functional theory (DFT) and electrochemical analyses support the description of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of 3 and 4 as possessing contributions from the metals and formamidinate bridging ligands, with Rh-2/form character, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) localized on the respective diimine ligand np and dap pi* orbitals. Both 3 and 4 display strong, low energy Rh-2/form -> diimine(pi*) metal/ligand-to-ligand charger transfer ((ML)-M-1-LCT) transitions with maxima at 566 nm (epsilon = 3600 M-1 cm(-1)) for 3 and at 630 nm (epsilon = 2900 M-1 cm(-1)) for 4 in CH3CN. Time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) calculations support these assignments. The ability of both the bridging np and chelating dap diimine ligands to produce strong absorption of these Rh-2(II,II) complexes throughout the visible region is potentially useful for the development of new photocatalysts for H-2 production and photochemotherapeutics.

An important contribution of this research is that it is demonstrated that a single robust fuzzy model can quantitatively capture cumulative effects of a range of particle sizes on membrane fouling Hence, empirical models incorporating fuzzy logical operators appear to encompass overall effects of non-linear colloidal transport and deposition mechanisms as well as changes in cake morphology and resistance with hydrodynamics better than mathematically complicated mechanistic models This also suggests the use of fuzzy logic algorithms in programmable control systems for improved on-site operation of membrane-based liquid-solid separation employed in municipalities and industries.

The method assumes that traveltimes follow a linear distribution on each boundary of cells. The linearity assumption of traveltimes facilitates the numerical implementation but its violation may result in large computational errors. In this paper, we propose a new way to mitigate the potential shortcoming hidden in the linear traveltime interpolation. We use the vertex traveltimes in a calculated cell to introduce an equivalent homogeneous medium that is specific to the cell boundary from a source. Therefore, we can decompose the traveltime at a point on the cell boundary into two parts: (1) a reference traveltime propagating in the equivalent homogeneous medium and (2) a perturbation traveltime that is defined as the difference between the original and reference traveltimes. We now treat that the traveltime perturbation is linear along each boundary of cells instead of the traveltime. With the new assumption, we carry out the bilinear interpolation over traveltime perturbation to complete traveltime computation in a 3-D heterogeneous model. The numerical experiments show that the new method, the linear traveltime perturbation interpolation, is able to achieve much higher accuracy than that based on the linear traveltime interpolation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0956-540X,1365-246X,,,,OCT,2015.0,203.0,1,,,,,548,552,,10.1093/gji/ggv316,,,,,,,WOS:000366492900038,,,,,,Houston

However, any associated changes in life expectancy remain largely unresolved. Murray and Nelson published a model of daily mortality and air pollution that addresses mortality displacement or harvesting by directly considering population dynamics on the basis of the assumption that a period of illness or frailty precedes most elderly deaths. The underlying concept is that a person's response to an environmental exposure also depends on his/her physiological ability to withstand stress at that time. They used Kalman filtering to estimate an unobservable quantity-the size of the frail subpopulation from which elderly (ages >= 65 yr) nontraumatic deaths are assumed to derive. They found a small subpopulation, relatively robust to environmental variations over 14 yr, with remaining life expectancies of 8-31 days in this frail status. Here, this model and dataset are expanded to examine the ramifications in more detail (including seasonality), to consider peak ozone as an additional pollutant, and to consider remaining life expectancies of the this frail subpopulation on a daily basis. Previous studies of mortality displacement and of Philadelphia mortality-air-pollution associations are also summarized in general, and agreement with the Murray-Nelson model was found, thus supporting its validity. The estimated additional mortality associated with a given environmental exposure persists for a few days at most but is not always compensated by subsequent mortality deficits. It is concluded that the pollution-associated mortality increases of a few percent in this dataset are consistent with losses of remaining life expectancy of up to a few days.

Although pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) datasets are commonly used to infer magnitude and rates of slip across detachment faults, correct use of these datasets requires a sound understanding of coupling effects between footwall deformation and advection of isotherms on the distribution of cooling ages. In this study we present thermo-kinematic modeling results which examine the relationship between different footwall kinematic models, erosion, and the spatial distribution of muscovite and biotite Ar-40/Ar-39 cooling ages. Our results show that large magnitudes of footwall erosion during normal faulting significantly affect cooling age patterns as footwall rocks at different distances from the fault surface pass through different thermal gradients. We apply our modeling results to simulating muscovite and biotite cooling-age patterns from the footwall of the Cenozoic Kongur Shan normal fault system in the Pamir. Previous studies had interpreted a documented similar to 5-fold increase in cooling rate at similar to 2 Ma to indicate an increase in exhumation rate during the Quaternary. However, our results show that the observed cooling age patterns and increase in cooling rate can be produced by a constant exhumation rate over the last 7 Ma due to the effect of changes in the rate of isotherm advection during exhumation.

In wintertime, the so-called East Asian Monsoon dominates, largely affecting the climate and meteorology of this region. Being located in the subtropical region, Taipei provides an ideal opportunity for studying interactions between high latitude cold and dry continental air masses and low to mid-latitude warm and wet oceanic air. Indeed, the dual isotope function, d-excess shows the presence of two distinct moisture sources, contributing to the winter vapor isotope variability. Undoubtedly, the dominant moisture source is the high latitude continental cold air masses reaching Taipei with d-excess values of >20%0. Alongside, wet and warm air masses characterized by strong airsea interaction from the surrounding oceans, possessing d-excess value of similar to 10%(0) also play a role. The interactions of these two distinct air masses cause the d-excess values to change by as much as similar to 20%(0) in a few days. Multiple regression analysis shows that source moisture composition and water vapor mixing ratio combined control over 60% of the observed variability. We developed a box model to show that both high and low d-excess events in the winter are primarily controlled by the humidity deficit over the ocean. The information obtained in this study could be used in interpreting the paleoclimate proxies within the East Asian region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sulfide-bearing mineralized rock samples from Ladakh terrane are analyzed for gold, silver, and base metals. Bulk samples analyses for gold, silver, and base metal concentrations demonstrate that almost all samples have variable amounts of gold, silver, and base metals. In these samples, gold concentration up to 95 ppm was found in chalcopyrite, galena-rich mineralized quartz veins, and their alteration products. The mineralized veins are few meters to 10 m wide and are associated with dioritic rocks. Dominant minerals in the mineralized zone include galena, chalcopyrite, limonite, pyrite, and malachite. The enrichment and depletion of different types of minerals suggest that the magmatic hydrothermal fluids played a key role in copper and lead mineralization with gold concentration. Study of ore minerals in these samples shows association with sulfide-bearing alterations in shear zones.","[Ahmad, Laeiq] Univ Swabi, Dept Geol, Anbar, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Laeiq] Univ Peshawar, Natl Ctr Excellence Geol, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Khan, Shuhab D.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Shah, M.

However, modeled ozone does not always agree with observations. A complementary approach is to measure the ozone production rate directly, leading to the development of the Measurement of Ozone Production Sensor (MOPS). Two improved second-generation MOPSv2s were deployed for NASA's DISCOVER-AQ field campaign in September 2013 at the University of Houston, 5 km south of downtown, and Smith Point, at the mouth of the Houston Ship Channel. Median September P(O-3) was low, consistent with the observed ambient ozone. The MOPSv2s provided statistically similar results when they were compared for 8 day sat the University of Houston. October measurements yielded a median ozone production rate of 27 +/- 11 ppbv hr(-1), falling within the range of calculated P(O-3) from prior Houston field campaigns in 2006 and 2009. Additionally, diurnal patterns are similar to model-derived ozone production from these previous campaigns. An advection analysis for a high ozone event on 25 September 2013 indicates that the Houston site was in a local ozone source region, while Smith Point ozone was likely enhanced by transport from other areas.

In several of these reconstructions, opening of the southern segment(s) by seafloor spreading prior to Aptian-Albian time is accompanied by contemporaneous strike-slip motion along an intraplate boundary extending southeastward from the Andean Cochabamba-Santa Cruz bend to the Rio Grande Fracture Zone (RGFZ). We have examined new magnetic data over the Pelotas, Santos and Campos Basins, offshore Argentina and Brazil, acquired by ION-GXT in tandem with long-offset, long record seismic reflection data, and identified seafloor spreading anomalies M4, M3, M2 and M0 (similar to 131, similar to 129, similar to 128 and similar to 125 Ma). Integrating these results with our earlier work, we have been able to correlate magnetochrons M4, M3, M2 and M0 north and south of the RGFZ on the South American margin, and north and south of the Walvis Ridge on the African side. Our results are therefore inconsistent with diachronous opening models that involve substantial continental strike-slip motion north of RGFZ during M4 to M0 time.
